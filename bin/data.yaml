  The following words and terms shall, for the purposes of this section and as used elsewhere in this 
  code, have the meanings shown herein. 
  AEROSOL. A product that is dispensed from an aerosol con- 
  tainer by a propellant. 
  Aerosol products shall be classified by means of the calcula- 
  tion of their chemical heats of combustion and shall be desig- 
  nated Level 1, 2 or 3. 
  Level 1 aerosol products. Those with a total chemical heat 
  of combustion that is less than or equal to 8,600 British ther- 
  mal units per pound (Btu/lb) (20 kJ/g). 
  Level 2 aerosol products. Those with a total chemical heat 
  of combustion that is greater than 8,600 Btu/lb (20 kJ/g), but 
  less than or equal to 13,000 Btu/lb (30 kJ/g). 
  Level 3 aerosol products. Those with a total chemical heat 
  combustion that is greater than 13,000 Btu/lb (30 kJ/g). 
  AEROSOL CONTAINER. A metal can or a glass or plastic 
  bottie designed to dispense an aerosol. Metal cans shall be lim- 
  ited to a maximum size of 33.8 fluid ounces (1,000 ml). Glass 
  or plastic bottles shall be limited to a maximum size of 4 fluid 
  ounces (118 ml). 
  BALED COTTON. A natural seed fiber wrapped in and 
  secured with industry accepted materials, usually consisting of 
  burlap, woven polypropylene, polyethylene or cotton or sheet 
  polyethylene, and secured with steel, synthetic or wire bands or 
  wire; also includes linters (lint removed from the cottonseed) 
  and motes (residual materials from the ginning process). 
  BALED COTTON, DENSELY PACKED. Cotton made into 
  banded bales with a packing density of at least 22 pounds per 
  cubic foot (360 kg/m^), and dimensions complying with the fol- 
  lowing: a length of 55 inches (1397 Â± 20 mm), a width of 21 
  inches (533.4 Â± 20 mm) and a height of 27.6 to 35.4 inches (701 to 
  899 mm). 
  BARRICADE. A structure that consists of a combination of 
  walls, floor and roof, which is designed to withstand the rapid 
  release of energy in an explosion and which is fully confined, 
  partially vented or fully vented; or other effective method of 
  shielding from explosive materials by a natural or artificial bar- 
  rier. 
  Artificial barricade. An artificial mound or revetment a 
  minimum thickness of 3 feet (914 mm). 
  Natural barricade. Natural features of the ground, such as 
  hills, or timber of sufficient density that the surrounding 
  exposures that require protection cannot be seen from the 
  magazine or building containing explosives when the trees 
  are bare of leaves. 
  BOILING POINT. The temperature at which the vapor pres- 
  sure of a liquid equals the atmospheric pressure of 14.7 pounds 
  per square inch (psi) (101 kPa) gage or 760 mm of mercury. 
  Where an accurate boiling point is unavailable for the material 
  in question, or for mixtures which do not have a constant boil- 
  ing point, for the purposes of this classification, the 20-percent 
  evaporated point of a distillation performed in accordance with 
  ASTM D 86 shall be used as the boiling point of the liquid. 
  CLOSED SYSTEM. The use of a solid or liquid hazardous 
  material involving a closed vessel or system that remains 
  closed during normal operations where vapors emitted by the 
  product are not liberated outside of the vessel or system and the 
  product is not exposed to the atmosphere during normal opera- 
  tions; and all uses of compressed gases. Examples of closed 
  systems for solids and liquids include product conveyed 
  through a piping system into a closed vessel, system or piece of 
  equipment. 
  COMBUSTIBLE DUST. Finely divided solid material that is 
  420 microns or less in diameter and which, when dispersed in 
  air in the proper proportions, could be ignited by a flame, spark 
  or other source of ignition. Combustible dust will pass through 
  a U.S. No. 40 standard sieve. 
  COMBUSTIBLE FIBERS. Readily ignitable and free-bum- 
  I ing materials in a fibrous or shredded form, such as cocoa fiber, 
  cloth, cotton, excelsior, hay, hemp, henequen, istle, jute, kapok, 
  oakum, rags, sisal, Spanish moss, straw, tow, wastepaper, cer- 
  Itain synthetic fibers or other like materials. This definition does 
  not include densely packed baled cotton. 
  COMBUSTIBLE LIQUID. A liquid having a closed cup 
  flash point at or above 100Â°F (38Â°C). Combustible liquids shall 
  be subdivided as follows: 
  Class II. Liquids having a closed cup flash point at or above 
  100Â°F (38Â°C) and below 140Â°F (60Â°C). 
  Class IIIA. Liquids having a closed cup flash point at or 
  above 140Â°F (60Â°C) and below 200Â°F (93Â°C). 
  Class IIIB. Liquids having a closed cup flash point at or 
  above 200Â°F (93Â°C). 
  The category of combustible liquids does not include com- 
  pressed gases or cryogenic fluids. 
  COMPRESSED GAS. A material, or mixture of materials 
  which: 
  1. Is a gas at 68Â°F (20Â°C) or less at 14.7 pounds per square 
  inch atmosphere (psia) (101 kPa) of pressure; and 
  2. Has a boiling point of 68Â°F (20Â°C) or less at 14.7 psia 
  (101 kPa) which is either liquefied, nonliquefied or in 
  solution, except those gases which have no other health- 
  or physical-hazard properties are hot considered to be 
  compressed until the pressure in the packaging exceeds 
  41 psia (282 kPa) at 68Â°F (20Â°C). 
  The states of a compressed gas are categorized as follows: 
  1. Nonliquefied compressed gases are gases, other than 
  those in solution, which are in a packaging under the 
  charged pressure and are entirely gaseous at a tempera- 
  ture of 68 Â°F (20Â°C). 
  2. Liquefied compressed gases are gases that, in a packag- 
  ing under the charged pressure, are partially liquid at a 
  temperature of 68Â°F (20Â°C). 
  3. Compressed gases in solution are nonliquefied gases that 
  are dissolved in a solvent. 
  4. Compressed gas mixtures consist of a mixture of two or 
  more compressed gases contained in a packaging, the 
  hazard properties of which are represented by the proper- 
  ties of the mixture as a whole. 
  CONTROL AREA. Spaces within a building where quanti- 
  ties of hazardous materials not exceeding the maximum 
  allowable quantities per control area are stored, dispensed, 
  used or handled. See also the definition of "Outdoor control 
  area" in the International Fire Code. 
  CORROSIVE. A chemical that causes visible destruction of, 
  or irreversible alterations in, living tissue by chemical action at 
  the point of contact. A chemical shall be considered corrosive 
  if, when tested on the intact skin of albino rabbits by the method 
  described in DOTn 49 CFR, Part 173.137, such a chemical 
  destroys or changes irreversibly the structure of the tissue at the 
  point of contact following an exposure period of 4 hours. This 
  term does not refer to action on inanimate surfaces. 
  CRYOGENIC FLUID. A liquid having a boiling point lower 
  than -150Â°F (-101Â°C) at 14.7 pounds per square inch atmo- 
  sphere (psia) (an absolute pressure of 101 kPa). 
  DAY BOX. A portable magazine designed to hold explosive 
  materials constructed in accordance with the requirements for 
  a Type 3 magazine as defined and classified in Chapter 33 of 
  the International Fire Code.

  DEFLAGRATION. An exothermic reaction, such as the 
  extremely rapid oxidation of a flammable dust or vapor in air, 
  in which the reaction progresses through the unbumed material 
  at a rate less than the velocity of sound. A deflagration can have 
  an explosive effect. 
  DETACHED BUILDING. A separate single-story building, 
  without a basement or crawl space, used for the storage or use 
  of hazardous materials and located an approved distance from 
  all structures. 
  DETONATION. An exothermic reaction characterized by the 
  presence of a shock wave in the material which establishes and 
  maintains the reaction. The reaction zone progresses through 
  the material at a rate greater than the velocity of souiid. The 
  principal heating mechanism is one of shock compression. 
  Detonations have an explosive effect. 
  DISPENSING. The pouring or transferring of any material 
  from a container, tank or similar vessel, whereby vapors, dusts, 
  fumes, mists or gases are liberated to the atmosphere. 
  EXPLOSIVE. Any chemical compound, mixture or device, 
  the primary or common purpose of which is to function by 
  explosion. The term includes, but is not limited to, dynamite, 
  black powder, pellet powder, initiating explosives, detonators, 
  safety fuses, squibs, detonating cord, igniter cord, igniters and 
  display fireworks, 1.3G (Class B, Special). 
  The term "explosive" includes any material determined to be 
  within the scope of USC Title 18: Chapter 40 and also includes 
  any material classified as an explosive other than consumer 
  fireworks, 1 .40 (Class C, Common) by the hazardous materi- 
  als regulations of DQTn 49 CFR. 
  High explosive. Explosive material, such as dynamite, 
  which can be caused to detonate by means of a No. 8 test 
  blasting cap when unconfined. 
  Low explosive. Explosive material that will bum or defla- 
  grate when ignited. It is characterized by a rate of reaction 
  that is less than the speed of sound. Examples of low explo- 
  sives include, but are not limited to, black powder; safety 
  fuse; igniters; igniter cord; fuse lighters; fireworks, 1.3G 
  (Class B, Special) and propellants, 1.3C. 
  Mass-detonating explosives. Division 1.1, 1.2 and 1.5 
  explosives alone or in combination, or loaded into various 
  types of ammunition or containers, most of which can be 
  expected to explode virtually instantaneously when a small 
  portion is subjected to fire, severe concussion, impact, the 
  impulse of an initiating agent or the effect of a considerable 
  discharge of energy from without. Materials that react in 
  this manner represent a mass explosion hazard. Such an 
  explosive will normally cause severe structural damage to 
  adjacent objects. Explosive propagation could occur imme- 
  diately to other items of ammunition and explosives stored 
  sufficiently close to and not adequately protected from the 
  initially exploding pile with a time interval short enough so 
  that two or more quantities must be considered as one for 
  quantity-distance purposes. 
  UN/DOTn Class 1 explosives. The former classification 
  system used by DQTn included the terms "high" and "low" 
  explosives as defined herein. The following terms further 
  define explosives under the current system applied by 
  DQTn for all explosive materials defined as hazard Class 1 
  materials. Compatibility group letters are used in concert 
  with the division to specify further limitations on each divi- 
  sion noted (i.e., the letter G identifies the material as a pyro- 
  technic substance or article containing a pyrotechnic 
  substance and similar materials). 
  Division 1.1. Explosives that have a mass explosion haz- 
  ard. A mass explosion is one which affects almost the 
  entire load instantaneously. 
  Division 1.2. Explosives that have a projection hazard 
  but not a mass explosion hazard. 
  Division 1.3. Explosives that have a fire hazard and 
  either a minor blast hazard or a minor projection hazard 
  or both, but not a mass explosion hazard. 
  Division 1.4. Explosives that pose a minor explosion 
  hazard. The explosive effects are largely confined to the 
  package and no projection of fragments of appreciable 
  size or range is to be expected. An external fire must not 
  cause virtually instantaneous explosion of almost the 
  entire contents of the package. 
  Division 1.5. Very insensitive explosives. This division 
  is comprised of substances that have a mass explosion 
  hazard, but that are so insensitive there is very little prob- 
  ability of initiation or of transition from burning to deto- 
  nation under normal conditions of transport. 
  Division 1.6. Extremely insensitive articles which do not 
  have a mass explosion hazard. This division is comprised 
  of articles that contain only extremely insensitive deto- 
  nating substances and which demonstrate a negligible 
  probability of accidental initiation or propagation. 
  FIREWORKS. Any composition or device for the purpose of 
  producing a visible or audible effect for entertainment pur- 
  poses by combustion, deflagration or detonation that meets the 
  definition of 1.4G fireworks or 1.3G fireworks as set forth 
  herein. 
  FIREWORKS, 1.3G. (Formerly Class B, Special Fireworks.) 
  Large fireworks devices, which are explosive materials, 
  intended for use in fireworks displays and designed to produce 
  audible or visible effects by combustion, deflagration or deto- 
  nation. Such 1 .3G fireworks include, but are not limited to, fire- 
  crackers containing more than 130 milligrams (2 grains) of 
  explosive composition, aerial shells containing more than 40 
  grams of pyrotechnic composition, and other display pieces 
  which exceed the limits for classification as 1.4G fireworks. 
  Such 1.3G fireworks are also described as fireworks, UN0335 
  by the DOTn. 
  FIREWORKS, 1.4G. (Formerly Class C, Common Fire- 
  works.) Small fireworks devices containing restricted amounts 
  of pyrotechnic composition designed primarily to produce vis- 
  ible or audible effects by combustion. Such 1.4G fireworks 
  which comply with the construction, chemical composition 
  and labeling regulations of the DOTn for fireworks, UN0336, 
  and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) as 
  set forth in CPSC 16 CFR: Parts 1500 and 1507, are not explo- 
  sive materials for the purpose of this code. 
  FLAMMABLE GAS. A material that is a gas at 68Â°F (20Â°C) 
  or less at 14.7 pounds per square inch atmosphere (psia) (101 
  kPa) of pressure [a material that has a boiling point of 68Â°F 
  (20Â°C) or less at 14.7 psia (101 kPa)] which: 
  1 . Is ignitable at 14.7 psia (101 kPa) when in a mixture of 13 
  percent or less by volume with air; or 
  2. Has a flammable range at 14.7 psia (101 kPa) with air of 
  at least 12 percent, regardless of the lower limit. 
  The limits specified shall be determined at 14.7 psi (101 kPa) 
  of pressure and a temperature of 68 Â°F (20Â°C) in accordance 
  with ASTME 681. 
  FLAMMABLE LIQUEFIED GAS. A liquefied compressed 
  gas which, under a charged pressure, is partially liquid at a tem- 
  perature of 68Â°F (20Â°C) and which is flammable. 
  FLAMMABLE LIQUID. A liquid having a closed cup flash 
  point below 100Â°F (38Â°C). Flammable liquids are further cate- 
  gorized into a group known as Class I liquids. The Class I cate- 
  gory is subdivided as follows: 
  Class lA. Liquids having a flash point below 73Â°F (23Â°C) 
  and a boiling point below 100Â°F (38Â°C). 
  Class IB. Liquids having a flash point below 73Â°F (23Â°C) 
  and a boiling point at or above 100Â°F (38Â°C). 
  Class IC. Liquids having a flash point at or above 73 Â°F 
  (23Â°C) and below 100Â°F (38Â°C). 
  The category of flammable liquids does not include com- 
  pressed gases or cryogenic fluids. 
  FLAMMABLE MATERIAL. A material capable of being 
  readily ignited from common sources of heat or at a temperature 
  of600Â°F(316Â°C)orless. 
  FLAMMABLE SOLID. A sohd, other than a blasting agent or 
  explosive, that is capable of causing fire through friction, 
  absorption or moisture, spontaneous chemical change, or 
  retained heat from manufacturing or processing, or which has an 
  ignition temperature below 212Â°F (100Â°C) or which bums so 
  vigorously and persistently when ignited as to create a serious 
  hazard. A chemical shall be considered a flammable solid as 
  determined in accordance with the test method of CPSC 16 
  CFR; Part 1500.44, if it ignites and bums with a self-sustained 
  flame at a rate greater than 0. 1 inch (2.5 mm) per second along its 
  major axis. 
  FLASH POINT. The minimum temperature in degrees Fahren- 
  heit at which a Uquid will give off sufficient vapors to form an 
  ignitable mixture with air near the surface or in the container, but 
  will not sustain combustion. The flash point of a liquid shall be 
  determined by appropriate test procedure and apparatus as spec- 
  ified in ASTM D 56, ASTM D 93 or ASTM D 3278. 
  HANDLING. The deUberate transport by any means to a point 
  of storage or use. 
  HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. Those chemicals or substances 
  that are physical hazards or health hazards as defined and classi- 
  fied in this section and the International Fire Code, whether the 
  materials are in usable or waste condition. 
  HEALTH HAZARD. A classification of a chemical for which 
  there is statistically significant evidence that acute or chronic 
  health effects are capable of occurring in exposed persons. The 
  term "health hazard" includes chemicals that are toxic or highly 
  toxic, and corrosive. 
  HIGHLY TOXIC. A material which produces a lethal dose or 
  lethal concentration that falls within any of the following catego- 
  ries: 
  1 . A chemical that has a median lethal dose (LD50) of 50 mil- 
  hgrams or less per kilogram of body weight when admin- 
  istered orally to albino rats weighing between 200 and 300 
  grams each. 
  2. A chemical that has a median lethal dose (LD50) of 200 
  milligrams or less per kilogram of body weight when 
  administered by continuous contact for 24 hours (or less if 
  death occurs within 24 hours) with the bare skin of albino 
  rabbits weighing between 2 and 3 kilograms each. 
  3. A chemical that has a median lethal concentration (LC50) 
  in air of 200 parts per milUon by volume or less of gas or 
  vapor, or 2 milUgrams per liter or less of mist, fume or 
  dust, when administered by continuous inhalation for 1 
  hour (or less if death occurs within 1 hour) to albino rats 
  weighing between 200 and 300 grams each. 
  Mixtures of these materials with ordinary materials, such as 
  water, might not warrant classification as highly toxic. While 
  this system is basically simple in application, any hazard evalua- 
  tion that is required for the precise categorization of this type of 
  material shall be performed by experienced, technically compe- 
  tent persons. 
  INCOMPATIBLE MATERIALS. Materials that, when 
  mixed, have the potential to react in a manner that generates 
  heat, fumes, gases or byproducts which are hazardous to life or 
  property. 
  OPEN SYSTEM. The use of a solid or liquid hazardous mate- 
  rial involving a vessel or system that is continuously open to the 
  atmosphere during normal operations and where vapors are 
  liberated, or the product is exposed to the atmosphere during 
  normal operations. Examples of open systems for solids and 
  liquids include dispensing from or into open beakers or con- 
  tainers, dip tank and plating tank operations. 
  OPERATING BUILDING. A building occupied in conjunc- 
  tion with the manufacture, transportation or use of explosive 
  materials. Operating buildings are separated from one another 
  with the use of intraplant or intraline distances. 
  ORGANIC PEROXIDE. An organic compound that contains 
  the bivalent -0-0- structure and which may be considered to be 
  a structural derivative of hydrogen peroxide where one or both 
  of the hydrogen atoms have been replaced by an organic radi- 
  cal. Organic peroxides can pose an explosion hazard (detona- 
  tion or deflagration) or they can be shock sensitive. They can 
  also decompose into various unstable compounds over an 
  extended period of time. 
  Class I. Those formulations that are capable of deflagration 
  but not detonation. 
  Class II. Those formulations that bum very rapidly and that 
  pose a moderate reactivity hazard. 
  Class III. Those formulations that bum rapidly and that 
  pose a moderate reactivity hazard. 
  Class IV. Those formulations that bum in the same manner 
  as ordinary combustibles and that pose a minimal reactivity 
  hazard. 
  Class V. Those formulations that bum with less intensity 
  than ordinary combustibles or do not sustain combustion 
  and that pose no reactivity hazard. 
  Unclassified detonable. Organic peroxides that are capable 
  of detonation. These peroxides pose an extremely high 
  explosion hazard through rapid explosive decomposition. 
  OXIDIZER. A material that readily yields oxygen or other 
  oxidizing gas, or that readily reacts to promote or initiate com- 
  bustion of combustible materials. Examples of other oxidizing 
  gases include bromine, chlorine and fluorine. 
  Class 4. An oxidizer that can undergo an explosive reaction 
  due to contamination or exposure to thermal or physical 
  shock. Additionally, the oxidizer will enhance the buming 
  rate and can cause spontaneous ignition of combustibles. 
  Class 3. An oxidizer that will cause a severe increase in the 
  buming rate of combustible materials with which it comes 
  in contact or that will undergo vigorous self-sustained 
  decomposition due to contamination or exposure to heat. 
  Class 2. An oxidizer that will cause a moderate increase in 
  the buming rate or that causes spontaneous ignition of com- 
  bustible materials with which it comes in contact. 
  Class 1. An oxidizer whose primary hazard is that it slightly 
  increases the buming rate but which does not cause sponta- 
  neous ignition when it comes in contact with combustible 
  materials. 
  OXIDIZING GAS. A gas that can support and accelerate 
  combustion of other materials. 
  PHYSICAL HAZARD. A chemical for which there is evi- 
  dence that it is a combustible liquid, compressed gas, cryo- 
  genic, explosive, flammable gas, flammable liquid, flammable 
  solid, organic peroxide, oxidizer, pyrophoric or unstable (reac- 
  tive) or water-reactive material. 
  PYROPHORIC. A chemical with an autoignition tempera- 
  ture in air, at or below a temperature of 130Â°F (54.4Â°C). 
  PYROTECHNIC COMPOSITION. A chemical mixmre 
  that produces visible light displays or sounds through a 
  self-propagating, heat-releasing chemical reaction which is 
  initiated by ignition. 
  TOXIC. A chemical falling within any of the following cate- 
  gories: 
  1 . A chemical that has a median lethal dose (LD50) of more 
  than 50 milligrams per kilogram, but not more than 500 
  milligrams per kilogram of body weight when adminis- 
  tered orally to albino rats weighing between 200 and 300 
  grams each. 
  2. A chemical that has a median lethal dose (LD50) of more 
  than 200 milligrams per kilogram but not more than 
  1,000 milligrams per kilogram of body weight when 
  administered by continuous contact for 24 hours (or less 
  if death occurs within 24 hours) with the bare skin of 
  albino rabbits weighing between 2 and 3 kilograms each. 
  3. A chemical that has a median lethal concentration (LC50) 
  in air of more than 200 parts per million but not more 
  than 2,000 parts per million by volume of gas or vapor, or 
  more than 2 milligrams per liter but not more than 20 mil- 
  ligrams per liter of mist, fume or dust, when adminis- 
  tered by continuous inhalation for 1 hour (or less if death 
  occurs within 1 hour) to albino rats weighing between 
  200 and 300 grams each. 
  UNSTABLE (REACTIVE) MATERIAL. A material, other 
  than an explosive, which in the pure state or as commercially 
  produced, will vigorously polymerize, decompose, condense 
  or become self-reactive and undergo other violent chemical 
  changes, including explosion, when exposed to heat, friction or 
  shock, or in the absence of an inhibitor, or in the presence of 
  contaminants, or in contact with incompatible materials. 
  Unstable (reactive) materials are subdivided as follows: 
  Class 4. Materials that in themselves are readily capable of 
  detonation or explosive decomposition or explosive reac- 
  tion at normal temperatures and pressures. This class 
  includes materials that are sensitive to mechanical or local- 
  ized thermal shock at normal temperatures and pressures. 
  Class 3. Materials that in themselves are capable of detona- 
  tion or of explosive decomposition or explosive reaction but 
  which require a strong initiating source or which must be 
  heated under confinement before initiation. This class 
  includes materials that are sensitive to thermal or mechani- 
  cal shock at elevated temperatures and pressures. 
  Class 2. Materials that in themselves are normally unstable 
  and readily undergo violent chemical change but do not det- 
  onate. This class includes materials that can undergo chemi- 
  cal change with rapid release of energy at normal 
  temperatures and pressures, and that can undergo violent 
  chemical change at elevated temperatures and pressures. 
  Class 1. Materials that in themselves are normally stable but 
  which can become unstable at elevated temperatures and 
  pressure. 
  WATER-REACTIVE MATERIAL. A material that 
  explodes; violently reacts; produces flammable, toxic or other 
  hazardous gases; or evolves enough heat to cause autoignition 
  or ignition of combustibles upon exposure to water or mois- 
  ture. Water-reactive materials are subdivided as follows: 
  Class 3. Materials that react explosively with water without 
  requiring heat or confinement. 
  Class 2. Materials that react violently with water or have the 
  ability to boil water. Materials that produce flammable, 
  toxic or other hazardous gases or evolve enough heat to 
  cause autoignition or ignition of combustibles upon expo- 
  sure to water or rhoisture. 
  Class 1. Materials that react with water with some release of 
  energy, but not violently.

  height. Garages with sides open around the entire building's 
  perimeter are permitted to be increased by 50 percent in area 
  and one tier in height. For a side to be considered open under 
  the above provisions, the total area of openings along the 
  side shall not be less than 50 percent of the interior area of 
  the side at each tier and such openings shall be equally dis- 
  tributed along the length of the tier. 
  Allowable tier areas in Table 406.3.5 shall be increased 
  for open parking garages constructed to heights less than the 
  table maximum. The gross tier area of the garage shall not 
  exceed that permitted for the higher structure. At least three 
  sides of each such larger tier shall have continuous horizon- 
  tal openings not less than 30 inches (762 mm) in clear height 
  extending for at least 80 percent of the length of the sides 
  and no part of such larger tier shall be more than 200 feet (60 
  960 mm) horizontally from such an opening. In addition, 
  each such opening shall face a street or yard accessible to a 
  street with a width of at least 30 feet (9144 mm) for the full 
  length of the opening, and standpipes shall be provided in 
  each such tier. 
  Open parking garages of Type II construction, with all 
  sides open, shall be unlimited in allowable area where the 
  height does not exceed 75 feet (22 860 mm). For a side to be 
  considered open, the total area of openings along the side 
  shall not be less than 50 percent of the interior area of the 
  side at each tier and such openings shall be equally distrib- 
  uted along the length of the tier. All portions of tiers shall be 
  within 200 feet (60 960 mm) horizontally from such open- 
  ings or other natural ventilation openings as defined in Sec-
