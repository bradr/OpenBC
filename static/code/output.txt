COMBUSTIBLE LIQUID. A liquid having a closed cup 
flash point at or above 100Â°F (38Â°C). Combustible liquids shall 
be subdivided as follows: 



Class II. Liquids having a closed cup flash point at or above 
100Â°F (38Â°C) and below 140Â°F (60Â°C). 

Class IIIA. Liquids having a closed cup flash point at or

The category of combustible liquids does not include com- 
pressed gases or cryogenic fluids. 

COMPRESSED GAS. A material, or mixture of materials 
which: 

1. Is a gas at 68Â°F (20Â°C) or less at 14.7 pounds per square 
inch atmosphere (psia) (101 kPa) of pressure; and 

2. Has a boiling point of 68Â°F (20Â°C) or less at 14.7 psia 
(101 kPa) which is either liquefied, nonliquefied or in 
solution, except those gases which have no other health- 
or physical-hazard properties are hot considered to be 
compressed until the pressure in the packaging exceeds 
41 psia (282 kPa) at 68Â°F (20Â°C). 

The states of a compressed gas are categorized as follows: 

1. Nonliquefied compressed gases are gases, other than 
those in solution, which are in a packaging under the 
charged pressure and are entirely gaseous at a tempera- 
ture of 68 Â°F (20Â°C). 

2. Liquefied compressed gases are gases that, in a packag- 
ing under the charged pressure, are partially liquid at a 
temperature of 68Â°F (20Â°C). 

3. Compressed gases in solution are nonliquefied gases that 
are dissolved in a solvent. 

4. Compressed gas mixtures consist of a mixture of two or 
more compressed gases contained in a packaging, the 
hazard properties of which are represented by the proper- 
ties of the mixture as a whole. 

CONTROL AREA. Spaces within a building where quanti- 
ties of hazardous materials not exceeding the maximum 
allowable quantities per control area are stored, dispensed, 
used or handled. See also the definition of "Outdoor control 
area" in the International Fire Code. 

CORROSIVE. A chemical that causes visible destruction of, 
or irreversible alterations in, living tissue by chemical action at 
the point of contact. A chemical shall be considered corrosive 
if, when tested on the intact skin of albino rabbits by the method 
described in DOTn 49 CFR, Part 173.137, such a chemical 
destroys or changes irreversibly the structure of the tissue at the 
point of contact following an exposure period of 4 hours. This 
term does not refer to action on inanimate surfaces. 

CRYOGENIC FLUID. A liquid having a boiling point lower 
than -150Â°F (-101Â°C) at 14.7 pounds per square inch atmo- 
sphere (psia) (an absolute pressure of 101 kPa).

DEFLAGRATION. An exothermic reaction, such as the 
extremely rapid oxidation of a flammable dust or vapor in air, 
in which the reaction progresses through the unbumed material 
at a rate less than the velocity of sound. A deflagration can have 
an explosive effect. 

DETACHED BUILDING. A separate single-story building, 
without a basement or crawl space, used for the storage or use 
of hazardous materials and located an approved distance from 
all structures. 

DETONATION. An exothermic reaction characterized by the 
presence of a shock wave in the material which establishes and 
maintains the reaction. The reaction zone progresses through 
the material at a rate greater than the velocity of souiid. The 
principal heating mechanism is one of shock compression. 
Detonations have an explosive effect. 

DISPENSING. The pouring or transferring of any material 
from a container, tank or similar vessel, whereby vapors, dusts, 
fumes, mists or gases are liberated to the atmosphere. 

EXPLOSIVE. Any chemical compound, mixture or device, 
the primary or common purpose of which is to function by 
explosion. The term includes, but is not limited to, dynamite, 
black powder, pellet powder, initiating explosives, detonators, 
safety fuses, squibs, detonating cord, igniter cord, igniters and 
display fireworks, 1.3G (Class B, Special). 

The term "explosive" includes any material determined to be 
within the scope of USC Title 18: Chapter 40 and also includes 
any material classified as an explosive other than consumer 
fireworks, 1 .40 (Class C, Common) by the hazardous materi- 
als regulations of DQTn 49 CFR. 

High explosive. Explosive material, such as dynamite, 
which can be caused to detonate by means of a No. 8 test 
blasting cap when unconfined. 



Low explosive. Explosive material that will bum or defla- 
grate when ignited. It is characterized by a rate of reaction 
that is less than the speed of sound. Examples of low explo- 
sives include, but are not limited to, black powder; safety 
fuse; igniters; igniter cord; fuse lighters; fireworks, 1.3G 
(Class B, Special) and propellants, 1.3C. 

Mass-detonating explosives. Division 1.1, 1.2 and 1.5 
explosives alone or in combination, or loaded into various 
types of ammunition or containers, most of which can be 
expected to explode virtually instantaneously when a small 
portion is subjected to fire, severe concussion, impact, the 
impulse of an initiating agent or the effect of a considerable 
discharge of energy from without. Materials that react in 
this manner represent a mass explosion hazard. Such an 
explosive will normally cause severe structural damage to 
adjacent objects. Explosive propagation could occur imme- 
diately to other items of ammunition and explosives stored 
sufficiently close to and not adequately protected from the 
initially exploding pile with a time interval short enough so 
that two or more quantities must be considered as one for 
quantity-distance purposes. 

UN/DOTn Class 1 explosives. The former classification 
system used by DQTn included the terms "high" and "low" 
explosives as defined herein. The following terms further 
define explosives under the current system applied by 
DQTn for all explosive materials defined as hazard Class 1 
materials. Compatibility group letters are used in concert 
with the division to specify further limitations on each divi- 
sion noted (i.e., the letter G identifies the material as a pyro- 
technic substance or article containing a pyrotechnic 
substance and similar materials). 

Division 1.1. Explosives that have a mass explosion haz- 
ard. A mass explosion is one which affects almost the 
entire load instantaneously. 



2006 INTERNATIONAL BUILDING CODEÂ®

USE AND OCCUPANCY CLASSIFICATION 



Division 1.2. Explosives that have a projection hazard 
but not a mass explosion hazard. 

Division 1.3. Explosives that have a fire hazard and 
either a minor blast hazard or a minor projection hazard 
or both, but not a mass explosion hazard. 

Division 1.4. Explosives that pose a minor explosion 
hazard. The explosive effects are largely confined to the 
package and no projection of fragments of appreciable 
size or range is to be expected. An external fire must not 
cause virtually instantaneous explosion of almost the 
entire contents of the package. 

Division 1.5. Very insensitive explosives. This division 
is comprised of substances that have a mass explosion 
hazard, but that are so insensitive there is very little prob- 
ability of initiation or of transition from burning to deto- 
nation under normal conditions of transport. 

Division 1.6. Extremely insensitive articles which do not 
have a mass explosion hazard. This division is comprised 
of articles that contain only extremely insensitive deto- 
nating substances and which demonstrate a negligible 
probability of accidental initiation or propagation. 

FIREWORKS. Any composition or device for the purpose of 
producing a visible or audible effect for entertainment pur- 
poses by combustion, deflagration or detonation that meets the 
definition of 1.4G fireworks or 1.3G fireworks as set forth 
herein. 

FIREWORKS, 1.3G. (Formerly Class B, Special Fireworks.) 
Large fireworks devices, which are explosive materials, 
intended for use in fireworks displays and designed to produce 
audible or visible effects by combustion, deflagration or deto- 
nation. Such 1 .3G fireworks include, but are not limited to, fire- 
crackers containing more than 130 milligrams (2 grains) of 
explosive composition, aerial shells containing more than 40 
grams of pyrotechnic composition, and other display pieces 
which exceed the limits for classification as 1.4G fireworks. 
Such 1.3G fireworks are also described as fireworks, UN0335 
by the DOTn. 

FIREWORKS, 1.4G. (Formerly Class C, Common Fire- 
works.) Small fireworks devices containing restricted amounts 
of pyrotechnic composition designed primarily to produce vis- 
ible or audible effects by combustion. Such 1.4G fireworks 
which comply with the construction, chemical composition 
and labeling regulations of the DOTn for fireworks, UN0336, 
and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) as 
set forth in CPSC 16 CFR: Parts 1500 and 1507, are not explo- 
sive materials for the purpose of this code. 

FLAMMABLE GAS. A material that is a gas at 68Â°F (20Â°C)

perature of 68Â°F (20Â°C) and which is flammable. 

FLAMMABLE LIQUID. A liquid having a closed cup flash 
point below 100Â°F (38Â°C). Flammable liquids are further cate- 
gorized into a group known as Class I liquids. The Class I cate- 
gory is subdivided as follows: 

Class lA. Liquids having a flash point below 73Â°F (23Â°C) 
and a boiling point below 100Â°F (38Â°C). 

Class IB. Liquids having a flash point below 73Â°F (23Â°C) 
and a boiling point at or above 100Â°F (38Â°C). 

Class IC. Liquids having a flash point at or above 73 Â°F 
(23Â°C) and below 100Â°F (38Â°C). 

The category of flammable liquids does not include com- 
pressed gases or cryogenic fluids. 

FLAMMABLE MATERIAL. A material capable of being 
readily ignited from common sources of heat or at a temperature 
of600Â°F(316Â°C)orless.

explosive, that is capable of causing fire through friction, 
absorption or moisture, spontaneous chemical change, or 
retained heat from manufacturing or processing, or which has an 
ignition temperature below 212Â°F (100Â°C) or which bums so 
vigorously and persistently when ignited as to create a serious 
hazard. A chemical shall be considered a flammable solid as 
determined in accordance with the test method of CPSC 16 
CFR; Part 1500.44, if it ignites and bums with a self-sustained 
flame at a rate greater than 0. 1 inch (2.5 mm) per second along its 
major axis. 

FLASH POINT. The minimum temperature in degrees Fahren- 
heit at which a Uquid will give off sufficient vapors to form an 
ignitable mixture with air near the surface or in the container, but 
will not sustain combustion. The flash point of a liquid shall be 
determined by appropriate test procedure and apparatus as spec- 
ified in ASTM D 56, ASTM D 93 or ASTM D 3278. 

HANDLING. The deUberate transport by any means to a point 
of storage or use. 

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. Those chemicals or substances 
that are physical hazards or health hazards as defined and classi- 
fied in this section and the International Fire Code, whether the 
materials are in usable or waste condition. 

HEALTH HAZARD. A classification of a chemical for which 
there is statistically significant evidence that acute or chronic 
health effects are capable of occurring in exposed persons. The 
term "health hazard" includes chemicals that are toxic or highly 
toxic, and corrosive. 

HIGHLY TOXIC. A material which produces a lethal dose or 
lethal concentration that falls within any of the following catego- 
ries: 

1 . A chemical that has a median lethal dose (LD50) of 50 mil-

dust, when administered by continuous inhalation for 1 
hour (or less if death occurs within 1 hour) to albino rats 
weighing between 200 and 300 grams each. 

Mixtures of these materials with ordinary materials, such as 
water, might not warrant classification as highly toxic. While 
this system is basically simple in application, any hazard evalua- 
tion that is required for the precise categorization of this type of 
material shall be performed by experienced, technically compe- 
tent persons. 

INCOMPATIBLE MATERIALS. Materials that, when 
mixed, have the potential to react in a manner that generates 
heat, fumes, gases or byproducts which are hazardous to life or 
property. 

OPEN SYSTEM. The use of a solid or liquid hazardous mate- 
rial involving a vessel or system that is continuously open to the 
atmosphere during normal operations and where vapors are

normal operations. Examples of open systems for solids and 
liquids include dispensing from or into open beakers or con- 
tainers, dip tank and plating tank operations. 

OPERATING BUILDING. A building occupied in conjunc- 
tion with the manufacture, transportation or use of explosive 
materials. Operating buildings are separated from one another 
with the use of intraplant or intraline distances. 

ORGANIC PEROXIDE. An organic compound that contains 
the bivalent -0-0- structure and which may be considered to be 
a structural derivative of hydrogen peroxide where one or both 
of the hydrogen atoms have been replaced by an organic radi- 
cal. Organic peroxides can pose an explosion hazard (detona- 
tion or deflagration) or they can be shock sensitive. They can 
also decompose into various unstable compounds over an 
extended period of time. 

Class I. Those formulations that are capable of deflagration

than ordinary combustibles or do not sustain combustion 
and that pose no reactivity hazard. 



Unclassified detonable. Organic peroxides that are capable 
of detonation. These peroxides pose an extremely high 
explosion hazard through rapid explosive decomposition. 

OXIDIZER. A material that readily yields oxygen or other 
oxidizing gas, or that readily reacts to promote or initiate com- 
bustion of combustible materials. Examples of other oxidizing 
gases include bromine, chlorine and fluorine. 

Class 4. An oxidizer that can undergo an explosive reaction 
due to contamination or exposure to thermal or physical 
shock. Additionally, the oxidizer will enhance the buming 
rate and can cause spontaneous ignition of combustibles.

the buming rate or that causes spontaneous ignition of com- 
bustible materials with which it comes in contact. 

Class 1. An oxidizer whose primary hazard is that it slightly 
increases the buming rate but which does not cause sponta- 
neous ignition when it comes in contact with combustible 
materials. 

OXIDIZING GAS. A gas that can support and accelerate 
combustion of other materials. 

PHYSICAL HAZARD. A chemical for which there is evi- 
dence that it is a combustible liquid, compressed gas, cryo- 
genic, explosive, flammable gas, flammable liquid, flammable 
solid, organic peroxide, oxidizer, pyrophoric or unstable (reac- 
tive) or water-reactive material. 

PYROPHORIC. A chemical with an autoignition tempera- 
ture in air, at or below a temperature of 130Â°F (54.4Â°C).

CHAPTER 4 

SPECIAL DETAILED REQUIREMENTS BASED 
ON USE AND OCCUPANCY 



SECTION 401 
SCOPE 

401.1 Detailed use and occupancy requirements. In addition 
to the occupancy and construction requirements in this code, 
the provisions of this chapter apply to the special uses and 
occupancies described herein. 



SECTION 402 
COVERED MALL BUILDINGS 

402.1 Scope. The provisions of this section shall apply to 
buildings or structures defined herein as covered mall buildings 
not exceeding three floor levels at any point nor more than three 
stories above grade plane. Except as specifically required by 
this section, covered mall buildings shall meet applicable pro- 
visions of this code. 

Exceptions: 

1. Foyers and lobbies of Groups B, R-1 and R-2 are not 
required to comply with this section. 

2. Buildings need not comply with the provisions of this 
section when they totally comply with other applica- 
ble provisions of this code. 

402.2 Definitions. The following words and terms shall, for the 
purposes of this chapter and as used elsewhere in this code, 
have the meanings shown herein. 

ANCHOR BUILDING. An exterior perimeter building of a 
group other than H having direct access to a covered mall build- 
ing but having required means of egress independent of the 
mall. 

COVERED MALL BUILDING. A single building enclosing 
a number of tenants and occupants such as retail stores, drink- 
ing and dining establishments, entertainment and amusement 
facilities, passenger transportation terminals, offices, and other 
similar uses wherein two or more tenants have a main entrance 
into one or more malls. For the purpose of this chapter, anchor 
buildings shall not be considered as a part of the covered mall 
building. 

FOOD COURT. A public seating area located in the mall that 
serves adjacent food preparation tenant spaces. 

GROSS LEASABLE AREA. The total floor area designed 
for tenant occupancy and exclusive use. The area of tenant 
occupancy is measured from the centerlines of joint partitions 
to the outside of the tenant walls. All tenant areas, including 
areas used for storage, shall be included in calculating gross 
leasable area. 

MALL. A roofed or covered common pedestrian area within a 
covered mall building that serves as access for two or more ten- 
ants and not to exceed three levels that are open to each other. 



402.3 Lease plan. Each covered mall building owner shall pro- 
vide both the building and fire departments with a lease plan 
showing the location of each occupancy and its exits after the 
certificate of occupancy has been issued. No modifications or 
changes in occupancy or use shall be made from that shown on 
the lease plan without prior approval of the building official. 

402.4 Means of egress. Each tenant space and the covered mall 
building shall be provided with means of egress as required by 
this section and this code. Where there is a conflict between the 
requirements of this code and the requirements of this section, 
the requirements of this section shall apply. 

402.4.1 Determination of occupant load. The occupant 
load permitted in any individual tenant space in a covered 
mall building shall be determined as required by this code. 
Means of egress requirements for individual tenant spaces 
shall be based on the occupant load thus determined. 

402.4.1.1 Occupant formula. In determining required 
means of egress of the mall, the number of occupants for 
whom means of egress are to be provided shall be based 
on gross leasable area of the covered mall building 
(excluding anchor buildings) and the occupant load fac- 
tor as determined by the following equation. 



OLF= (0.00007) (GLA) + 25 
where: 



(Equation 4-1) 



OLF= The occupant load factor (square feet per per- 
son). 

GLA= The gross leasable area (square feet). 

402.4.1.2 OLE range. The occupant load factor (OLF) is 
not required to be less than 30 and shall not exceed 50. 

402.4.1.3 Anchor buildings. The occupant load of 
anchor buildings opening into the mall shall not be 
included in computing the total number of occupants for 
the mall. 

402.4.1.4 Food courts. The occupant load of a food 
court shall be determined in accordance with Section 
1004. For the purposes of determining the means of 
egress requirements for the mall, the food court occupant 
load shall be added to the occupant load of the covered 
mall building as calculated above. 

402.4.2 Number of means of egress. Wherever the dis- 
tance of travel to the mall from any location within a ten- 
ant space used by persons other than employees exceeds 
75 feet (22 860 mm) or the tenant space has an occupant 
load of 50 or more, not less than two means of egress shall 
be provided. 

402.4.3 Arrangements of means of egress. Assembly 
occupancies with an occupant load of 500 or more shall be 
so located in the covered mall building that their entrance

mall shall not be included in determining means of egress 
requirements for the mall. The path of egress travel of 
malls shall not exit through anchor buildings. Malls ter- 
minating at an anchor building where no other means of 
egress has been provided shall be considered as a 
dead-end mall. 

402.4.4 Distance to exits. Within each individual tenant 
space in a covered mall building, the maximum distance of 
travel from any point to an exit or entrance to the mall shall

b. The distance listed is the distance to lot line, including lot lines at public ways. 

c. For the purpose of this table, an inhabited building is any building on the same lot that is regularly occupied by people. Where two or more buildings containing 
explosives or magazines are located on the same lot, each building or magazine shall comply with the minimum distances specified from inhabited buildings and, 
in addition, they shall be separated from each other by not less than the distance shown for "Separation of magazines," except that the quantity of explosive materi- 
als contained in detonator buildings or magazines shall govern in regard to the spacing of said detonator buildings or magazines from buildings or magazines con- 
taining other explosive materials. If any two or more buildings or magazines are separated from each other by less than the specified "Separation' of Magazines" 
distances, then such two or more buildings or magazines, as a group, shall be considered as one building or magazine, and the total quantity of explosive materials 
stored in such group shall be treated as if the explosive were in a single building or magazine located on the site of any building or magazine of the group, and shall 
comply with the minimum distance specified from other magazines or inhabited buildings. 

d. Barricades shall effectively screen the building containing explosives from other buildings, public ways or magazines. Where mounds or revetted walls of earth are 
used for barricades, they shall not be less than 3 feet in thickness . A straight line from the top of any side wall of the building containing explosive materials to the 
eave line of any other building, magazine or a point 12 feet above the centerline of a pubUc way shall pass through the barricades.

K ={4 +[A X // ] + [A X ^J} (Equation5-l) 

where: 

Afl = Allowable area per story (square feet). 

At = Tabular area per story in accordance with Table 503 
(square feet). 

// = Area increase factor due to frontage as calculated in 
accordance with Section 506.2. 

Is = Area increase factor due to sprinkler protection as cal- 
culated in accordance with Section 506.3. 

506.1.1 Basements. A single basement that is not a story 
above grade plane need not be included in the total allow- 
able area, provided such basement does not exceed the area 
permitted for a building with no more than one story above 
grade plane. 

506.2 Frontage increase. Every building shall adjoin or have 
access to a public way to receive an area increase for frontage. 
Where a building has more than 25 percent of its perimeter on a 
public way or open space having a minimum width of 20 feet 
(6096 mm), the frontage increase shall be determined in accor- 
dance with the following: 



I If=[F/P-0.25]W/30 



(Equation 5-2) 



where: 



F 



P 

W 



= Area increase due to frontage.

with Section 506.2.1. 

506.2.1 Width limits. "W" must be at least 20 feet (6096 
mm). Where the value of W varies along the perimeter of the 
building, the calculation performed in accordance with 
Equation 5-2 shall be based on the weighted average of each 



portion of exterior wall and open space where the value of W 
is greater than or equal to 20 feet (6096 mm). Where W 
exceeds 30 feet (9144 mm), a value of 30 feet (9144 mm) 
shall be used in calculating the weighted average, regardless 
of the actual width of the open space. 

Exception: The quantity of Wdivided by 30 shall be per- 
mitted to be a maximum of 2 when the building meets all 
requirements of Section 507 except for compliance with 
the 60-foot (18 288 nun) public way or yard requirement,

SECTION 703 
FIRE-RESISTANCE RATINGS AND FIRE TESTS 

703.1 Scope. Materials prescribed herein for fire resistance 
shall conform to the requirements of this chapter. 

703.2 Fire-resistance ratings. The fire-resistance rating of 
building elements shall be determined in accordance with the 
test procedures set forth in ASTM E 1 19 or in accordance with 
Section 703.3. Where materials, systems or devices that have 
not been tested as part of a fire-resistance-rated assembly are 
incorporated into the assembly, sufficient data shall be made 
available to the building official to show that the required 
fire-resistance rating is not reduced. Materials and methods of 
construction used to protect joints and penetrations in 
fire-resistance-rated building elements shall not reduce the 
required fire-resistance rating. 

Exception: In determining the fire-resistance rating of exte- 
rior bearing walls, compliance with the ASTM E 1 19 crite- 
ria for unexposed surface temperature rise and ignition of 
cotton waste due to passage of flame or gases is required 
only for a period of time corresponding to the required 
fire-resistance rating of an exterior nonbearing wall with the 
same fire separation distance, and in a building of the same 
group. When the fire-resistance rating determined in accor- 
dance with this exception exceeds the fire-resistance rating 
determined in accordance with ASTM E 1 19, the fire expo- 
sure time period, water pressure, and application duration 
criteria for the hose stream test of ASTM E 119 shall be 
based upon the fire-resistance rating determined in accor- 
dance with this exception. 

703.2.1 Nonsymmetrical wall construction. Interior walls 
and partitions of nonsymmetrical construction shall be 
tested with both faces exposed to the furnace, and the 
assigned fire-resistance rating shall be the shortest duration 
obtained from the two tests conducted in compliance with 
ASTM E 1 19. When evidence is furnished to show that the 
wall was tested with the least fire-resistant side exposed to 
the furnace, subject to acceptance of the building official, 
the wall need not be subjected to tests from the opposite side 
(see Section 704.5 for exterior walls). 

703.2.2 Combustible components. Combustible aggre- 
gates are permitted in gypsum and portland cement concrete 
mixtures approved for fire-resistance-rated construction. 
Any approved component material or admixture is permit- 
ted in assembUes if the resulting tested assembly meets the 
fire-resistance test requirements of this code. 

703.2.3 Restrained classification. Fire-resistance-rated 
assembhes tested under ASTM E 119 shall not be consid- 
ered to be restrained unless evidence satisfactory to the 
building official is furnished by the registered design pro- 
fessional showing that the construction qualifies for a 
restrained classification in accordance with ASTM E 119. 
Restrained construction shall be identified on the plans. 

703.3 Alternative methods for determining fire resistance. 

The application of any of the alternative methods listed in this 



90 



2006 INTERNATIONAL BUILDING CODEÂ® 



FIRE-RESISTANCE-RATED CONSTRUCTION 



section shall be based on the fire exposure and acceptance crite- 
ria specified in ASTM E 1 19. The required fire resistance of a 
building element shall be permitted to be established by any of 
the following methods or procedures: 

1. Fire-resistance designs documented in approved 
sources. 

2. Prescriptive designs of fire-resistance-rated building 
elements as prescribed in Section 720. 

3. Calculations in accordance with Section 721. 

4. Engineering analysis based on a comparison of building 
element designs having fire-resistance ratings as deter- 
mined by the test procedures set forth in ASTM E 1 19. 

5. Alternative protection methods as allowed by Section 
104.11. 

703.4 Noncombustibility tests. The tests indicated in Sections 
703.4.1 and 703.4.2 shall serve as criteria for acceptance of 
building materials as set forth in Sections 602.2, 602.3 and 
602.4 in Type I, II, III and IV construction. The term 
"noncombustible" does not apply to the flame spread charac- 
teristics of interior finish or trim materials. A material shall not 
be classified as a noncombustible building construction mate- 
rial if it is subject to an increase in combustibility or flame 
spread beyond the limitations herein established through the 
effects of age, moisture or other atmospheric conditions. 

703.4.1 Elementary materials. Materials required to be 
noncombustible shall be tested in accordance with ASTM E 
136. 

703.4.2 Composite materials. Materials having a struc- 
tural base of noncombustible material as determined in 
accordance with Section 703.4.1 with a surfacing not more 
than 0.125 inch (3.18 mm) thick that has a flame spread 
index not greater than 50 when tested in accordance with 
ASTM E 84 shall be acceptable as noncombustible materi- 
als.

fire-retardant-treated wood or as required by Section 
1406.3. 

Exception: Type V construction shall be allowed for R-3 
occupancies. 

704.3 Buildings on the same lot. For the purposes of deter- 
mining the required wall and opening protection and roof-cov- 
ering requirements, buildings on the same lot shall be assumed 
to have an imaginary line between them. 

Where a new building is to be erected on the same lot as an 
existing building, the location of the assumed imaginary line 
with relation to the existing building shall be such that the exte- 
rior wall and opening protection of the existing building meet 
the criteria as set forth in Sections 704.5 and 704.8. 

Exception: Two or more buildings on the same lot shall 
either be regulated as separate buildings or shall be consid- 
ered as portions of one building if the aggregate area of such 
buildings is within the limits specified in Chapter 5 for a sin- 
gle building. Where the buildings contain different occu- 
pancy groups or are of different types of construction, the 
area shall be that allowed for the most restrictive occupancy 
or construction. 

704.4 Materials. Exterior walls shall be of materials permitted 
by the building type of construction. 

704.5 Fire-resistance ratings. Exterior walls shall be 
fire-resistance rated in accordance with Tables 601 and 602. 
The fire-resistance rating of exterior walls with a fire separa- 
tion distance of greater than 5 feet (1524 mm) shall be rated for 
exposure to fire from the inside. The fu-e-resistance rating of 
exterior walls with a fire separation distance of 5 feet (1524 
mm) or less shall be rated for exposure to fu-e from both sides. 

704.6 Structural stability. The wall shall extend to the height 
required by Section 704.1 1 and shall have sufficient structural 
stability such that it will remain in place for the duration of time 
indicated by the required fire-resistance rating. 

704.7 Unexposed surface temperature. Where protected 
openings are not limited by Section 704.8, the limitation on the 
rise of temperature on the unexposed surface of exterior walls 
as required by ASTM E 1 19 shall not apply. Where protected 
openings are limited by Section 704.8, the limitation on the rise 
of temperature on the unexposed surface of exterior walls as 
required by ASTM E 1 19 shall not apply provided that a cor- 
rection is made for radiation from the unexposed exterior wall 
surface in accordance with the following fonnula:

and 720.1(3) shall be assumed to have the fire-resistance rat- 
ings prescribed therein. Where materials that change the capac- 
ity for heat dissipation are incorporated into a 
fire-resistance-rated assembly, fire test results or other substan- 
tiating data shall be made available to the building official to 
show that the required fire-resistance-rating time period is not 
reduced. 

720.1.1 Thickness of protective coverings. The thickness 
of fire-resistant materials required for protection of struc- 
tural members shall be not less than set forth in Table 
720.1(1), except as modified in this section. The figures 
shown shall be the net thickness of the protecting materials 
and shall not include any hollow space in back of the protec- 
tion. 

720.1.2 Unit masonry protection. Where required, metal 
ties shall be embedded in bed joints of unit masonry for pro- 
tection of steel columns. Such ties shall be as set forth in 
Table 720.1(1) or be equivalent thereto. 

720.1.3 Reinforcement for cast-in-place concrete col- 
umn protection. Cast-in-place concrete protection for steel 
columns shall be reinforced at the edges of such members 
with wire ties of not less than 0. 1 8 inch (4.6 mm) in diameter 
wound spirally around the columns on a pitch of not more 
than 8 inches (203 mm) or by equivalent reinforcement.

est surface, the cover shall not be less than that set forth in 
Table 720.1(1). For members having multiple tendons 
installed with variable concrete cover, the average tendon 
cover shall not be less than that set forth in Table 720.1(1), 
provided: 

1. The clearance from each tendon to the nearest 
exposed surface is used to determine the average 
cover. 

2. In no case can the clear cover for individual tendons 
be less than one-half of that set forth in Table 
720.1(1). A minimum cover of 0.75 inch (19.1 mm) 
for slabs and 1 inch (25 mm) for beams is required for

721.2.1.2.2 Foam plastic insulation. The fire-resis- 
tance ratings of precast concrete wall panels consist- 
ing of a layer of foam plastic insulation sandwiched 
between two wythes of concrete shall be permitted to 
be determined by use of Equation 7-4. Foam plastic 
insulation with a total thickness of less than 1 inch (25 
mm) shall be disregarded. The /?â value for thickness 
of foam plastic insulation of 1 inch (25 mm) or 
greater, for use in the calculation, is 5 minutes; there- 
fore /?â059 = 2.5. 

721.2.1.3 Joints between precast wall panels. Joints 
between precast concrete wall panels which are not insu- 
lated as required by this section shall be considered as 
openings in walls. Uninsulated joints shall be included in 
determining the percentage of openings permitted by 
Table 704.8. Where openings are not permitted or are 
required by this code to be protected, the provisions of 
this section shall be used to determine the amount of joint 
insulation required. Insulated joints shall not be consid- 
ered openings for purposes of determining compliance 
with the allowable percentage of openings in Table 
704.8. 

721.2.1.3.1 Ceramic fiber joint protection. Figure 
721.2.1.3.1 shows thicknesses of ceramic fiber blan- 
kets to be used to insulate joints between precast con- 
crete wall panels for various panel thicknesses and for 
joint widths of % inch (9.5 mm) and 1 inch (25 mm) 



for fire-resistance ratings of 1 hour to 4 hours. For 
joint widths between Vg inch (9.5 mm) and 1 inch (25 
mm), the thickness of Ceramic fiber blanket is allowed 
to be determined by direct interpolation. Other tested 
and labeled materials are acceptable in place of 
ceramic fiber blankets. 

721.2.1.4 Walls with gypsum wallboard or plaster JBn- 
ishes. The fire-resistance rating of cast-in-place or pre- 
cast concrete walls with finishes of gypsum wallboard or 
plaster applied to one or both sides shall be permitted to 
be calculated in accordance with the provisions of this 
section. 

721.2.1.4.1 Nonfire-exposed side. Where the finish 
of gypsum wallboard or plaster is applied to the side 
of the wall not exposed to fire, the contribution of the 
finish to the total fire-resistance rating shall be deter- 
mined as follows: The thickness of the finish shall 
first be corrected by multiplying the actual thickness 
of the finish by the applicable factor determined from 
Table 721.2.1.4(1) based on the type of aggregate in 
the concrete. The corrected thickness of finish shall 
then be added to the actual or equivalent thickness of 
concrete and fire-resistance rating of the concrete and 
finish determined from Table 721.2.1.1, Figure 
721.2.1.2 or Table 721.2.1.2(1). 

721.2.1.4.2 Fire-exposed side. Where gypsum wall- 
board or plaster is applied to the fire-exposed side of 
the wall, the contribution of the finish to the total 
fire-resistance rating shall be determined as follows: 
The time assigned to the finish as estabUshed by Table 
721.2.1 .4(2) shall be added to the fire-resistance rating 
determined from Table 721.2.1.1 or Figure 721.2.1.2, 
or Table 721.2.1.2(1) for the concrete alone, or to the 
rating determined in Section 721.2.1.4.1 for the con- 
crete and finish on the nonfire-exposed side.

be performed twice, assuming either side of the wall 
to be the fire-exposed side. The fire-restance rating of 
the wall shall not exceed the lower of the two values. 

Exception: For an exterior wall with more than 5 
feet (1524 mm) of horizontal separation, the fire 
shall be assumed to occur on the interior side only. 

721.2.1.4.4 Minimmn concrete fire-resistaiice rat- 
ing. Where finishes apphed to one or both sides of a 
concrete wall contribute to the fire-resistance rating, 
the concrete alone shall provide not less than one-half 
of the total required fire-resistance rating. Addition- 
ally, the contribution to the fire resistance of the finish 
on the nonfire-exposed side of a load-bearing wall shall 
not exceed one-half the contribution of the concrete 
alone. 

721.2.1.4.5 Concrete finishes. Finishes on concrete 
walls that are assumed to contribute to the total 
fire-resistance rating of the wall shall comply with the 
installation requirements of Section 721.3.2.5. 

721.2.2 Concrete floor and roof slabs. Reinforced and 
prestressed floors and roofs shall comply with Section 
721.2.2.1. Multicourse floors and roofs shall comply with 
Sections 721.2.2.2 and 721.2.2.3, respectively.

721.2.2.3 Multicourse roofs. The fire-resistance ratings 
of roofs which consist of a base slab of concrete with a 
topping (overlay) of an insulating concrete or with an 
insulating board and built-up roofing shall comply with 
Figures 721.2.2.3(1) and 721.2.2.3(2). 

721.2.2.3.1 Heat transfer. For the transfer of heat, 
three-ply built-up roofing contributes 10 minutes to 
the fire-resistance rating. The fire-resistance rating 
for concrete assemblies such as those shown in Figure 
721.2.2.3(1) shall be increased by 10 minutes. This 
increase is not applicable to those shown in Figure 
721.2.2.3(2). 

721.2.2.4 Joints in precast slabs. Joints between adja- 
cent precast concrete slabs need not be considered in cal- 
culating the slab thickness provided that a concrete 
topping at least 1 inch (25 mm) thick is used. Where no 
concrete topping is used, joints must be grouted to a 
depth of at least one-third the slab thickness at the joint, 
but not less than 1 inch (25 mm), or the joints must be 
made fixe resistant by other approved methods. 

721.2.3 Concrete cover over reinforcement. The mini- 
mum thickness of concrete cover over reinforcement in con- 
crete slabs, reinforced beams and prestressed beams shall 
comply with this section. 



721.2.3.1 Slab cover. The minimum thickness of con- 
crete cover to the positive moment reinforcement shall 
comply with Table 721.2.3(1) for reinforced concrete 
and Table 721.2.3(2) for prestressed concrete. These 
tables are applicable for solid or hollow-core one-way or 
two-way slabs with flat undersurfaces. These tables are 
applicable to slabs that are either cast in place or precast. 
For precast prestressed concrete not covered elsewhere, 
the procedures contained in PCI MNL 124 shall be 
acceptable. 

721.2.3.2 Reinforced beam cover. The minimum thick- 
ness of concrete cover to the positive moment reinforce- 
ment (bottom steel) for reinforced concrete beams is 
shown in Table 721.2.3(3) for fire-resistance ratings of 1 
hour to 4 hours. 

721.2.3.3 Prestressed beam cover. The minimum thick- 
ness of concrete cover to the positive moment 
prestressing tendons (bottom steel) for restrained and 
unrestrained prestressed concrete beams and stemmed 
units shall comply with the values shown in Tables 
721.2.3(4) and 721.2.3(5) for fire-resistance ratings of 1 
hour to 4 hours. Values in Table 721.2.3(4) apply to 
beams 8 inches (203 mm) or greater in width. Values in 
Table 721.2.3(5) apply to beams or stems of any width, 
provided the cross-section area is not less than 40 square 
inches (25 806 mm^). In case of differences between the 
values determined from Table 721.2.3(4) or 721.2.3(5), 
it is permitted to use the smaller value. The concrete 
cover shall be calculated in accordance with Section 
721.2.3.3.1. The minimum concrete cover for 
nonprestressed reinforcement in prestressed concrete 
beams shall comply with Section 721.2.3.2. 

721.2.3.3.1 Calculating concrete cover. The con- 
crete cover for an individual tendon is the minimum 
thickness of concrete between the surface of the ten- 
don and the fire-exposed surface of the beam, except 
that for ungrouped ducts, the assumed cover thick- 
ness is the minimum thickness of concrete between 
the surface of the duct and the fire-exposed surface 
of the beam. For beams in which two or more ten- 
dons are used, the cover is assumed to be the average 
of the minimum cover of the individual tendons. For 
corner tendons (tendons equal distance from the bot- 
tom and side), the minimum cover used in the calcu- 
lation shall be one-half the actual value. For 
stemmed members with two or more prestressing 
tendons located along the vertical centerline of the 
stem, the average cover shall be the distance from the 
bottom of the member to the centroid of the tendons. 
The actual cover for any individual tendon shall not 
be less than one-half the smaller value shown in 
Tables 721 .2.3(4) and 72 1 .2.3(5), or 1 inch (25 mm), 
whichever is greater.

inch (25 mm) times the number of hours of required fire 
resistance or 2 inches (5 1 mm), whichever is less. 

721.2.4.3 Columns built into walls. The minimum 
dimensions of Table 72 1 .2.4 do not apply to a reinforced 
concrete column that is built into a concrete or masonry 
wall provided all of the following are met: 

1 . The fire-resistance rating for the wall is equal to or 
greater than the required rating of the column; 

2. The main longitudinal reinforcing in the column 
has cover not less than that required by Section

721.3.1 Equivalent thickness. The equivalent thickness of 
concrete masonry construction shall be determined in 
accordance with the provisions of this section. 

721.3.1.1 Concrete masonry unit plus finishes. The 

equivalent thickness of concrete masonry assemblies. 



r^a, shall be computed as the sum of the equivalent thick- 
ness of the concrete masonry unit, T^, as determined by 
Section 721.3.1.2, 721.3.1.3, or 721.3.1.4, plus the 
equivalent thickness of finishes, T^p determined in accor- 
dance with Section 721.3.2: 

T,â = T, + T,f (Equation 7-6) 

T^=Vâ/LH= Equivalent thickness of concrete 
masonry unit (inch) (mm). 

where: 

Vâ = Net volume of masonry unit (inch^) (mm^). 

L = Specified length of masonry unit (inch) (mm). 

H = Specified height of masonry unit (inch) (mm). 

721.3.1.2 Ungrouted or partially grouted construc- 
tion. T^ shall be the value obtained for the concrete 
masonry unit determined in accordance with ASTM C 
140. 

721.3.1.3 Solid grouted construction. The equivalent 
thickness, T^, of solid grouted concrete masonry units is 
the actual thickness of the unit. 

721.3.1.4 Airspaces and cells filled with loose-fill 
material. The equivalent thickness of completely filled 
hollow concrete masonry is the actual thickness of the 
unit when loose-fill materials are: sand, pea gravel, 
crushed stone, or slag that meet ASTM C 33 require- 
ments; pumice, scoria, expanded shale, expanded clay, 
expanded slate, expanded slag, expanded fly ash, or cin- 
ders that comply with ASTM C 33 1 ; or perlite or vermic- 
ulite meeting the requirements of ASTM C 549 and 
ASTM C 516, respectively. 

721.3.2 Concrete masonry walls. The fire-resistance rat- 
ing of walls and partitions constructed of concrete masonry 
units shall be determined from Table 721.3.2. The rating 
shall be based on the equivalent thickness of the masonry 
and type of aggregate used. 

721.3.2.1 Finish on nonfire-exposed side. Where plas- 
ter or gypsum wallboard is applied to the side of the wall 
not exposed to fire, the contribution of the finish to the 
total fire-resistance rating shall be determined as fol- 
lows: The thickness of gypsum wallboard or plaster shall 
be corrected by multiplying the actual thickness of the 
finish by applicable factor determined from Table 
721.2.1.4(1). This corrected thickness of finish shall be 
added to the equivalent thickness of masonry and the 
fire-resistance rating of the masonry and finish deter- 
mined from Table 721.3.2. 

721.3.2.2 Finish on fire-exposed side. Where plaster or 
gypsum wallboard is applied to the fire-exposed side of 
the wall, the contribution of the finish to the total 
fire-resistance rating shall be determined as follows: The 
time assigned to the finish as established by Table 
721.2.1.4(2) shall be added to the fire-resistance rating 
determined in Section 721.3.2 for the masonry alone, or 
in Section 721.3.2.1 for the masonry and finish on the 
nonfire-exposed side.

a. When the inside perimeter of the concrete protection is not square, L shall be 
taken as the average of L, and L-^. When the thickness of concrete cover is not 
constant, h shall be taken as the average of /i, and h^. 

b. Joints shall be protected with a minimum 1 inch thickness of ceramic fiber 
blanket but in no case less than one-half the thickness of the column cover 
(see Section 720.2.1.3). 

721.5.1.4.1 Reentrant space filled. For wide-flange 
steel columns completely encased in concrete with all 
reentrant spaces filled [Figure 721.5.1(6)(c)], the 
thermal capacity of the concrete within the reentrant 
spaces shall be permitted to be added to the thermal 
capacity of the steel column, as follows: 



//= 0. 1 1 W+ (p,cy 144) (^// -A,) 
where: 



(Equation 7-15) 



d = 

A = 



Flange width of the steel column (inches). 

Depth of the steel column (inches). 

Cross-sectional area of the steel column (square 
inches). 



721.5.1.4.2 Concrete properties unknown. If spe- 
cific data on the properties of concrete are not avail- 
able, the values given in Table 721.5.1(2) are 
permitted. 

721.5.1.4.3 Minimum concrete cover. For structural 
steel column encased in concrete with all reentrant 
spaces filled. Figure 721.5.1(6)(c) and Tables 
721.5.1(7) and 721.5.1(8) indicate the thickness of 
concrete cover required for various fire-resistance rat- 
ings for typical wide-flange sections. The thicknesses 
of concrete indicated in these tables also apply to 
structural steel columns larger than those listed.

721.5.1.4.4 Minimum precast concrete cover. For 

structural steel columns protected with precast con- 
crete column covers as shown in Figure 
721.5. l(6)(a), Tables 721.5.1(9) and 721.5.1(10) 
indicate the thickness of the column covers required 
for various fire-resistance ratings for typical 
wide-flange shapes. The thicknesses of concrete 
given in these tables also apply to structural steel col- 
umns larger than those listed. 

721.5.1.4.5 Masonry protection. The fire resistance 
of structural steel columns protected with concrete 
masonry units or clay masonry units as illustrated in 
Figure 721.5.1(7), shall be permitted to be deter- 
mined from the following expression: 

R = 0.ll (W/D)^' + [0.285 (T,'-^/K^-^) ] 

[1.0 -H 42.7 { (A A T,) I (0.25/7 + TJ } Â»Â« ] 

(Equation 7-16) 

where: 

R = Fire-resistance rating of column assembly 
(hours). 

W = Average weight of steel column (pounds per 
foot). 

D = Heated perimeter of steel column (inches) [see 
Figure 721.5.1(7)]. 

Tg = Equivalent thickness of concrete or clay 
masonry unit (inches) (see Table 721 .3.2 Note a 
or Section 721.4.1). 

K = Thermal conductivity of concrete or clay 
masonry unit (Btu/hr ft Â°F) [see Table 
721.5.1(3)]. 

A^ = Cross-sectional area of steel column (square 
inches). 

d^ = Density of the concrete or clay masonry unit 
(pounds per cubic foot). 

p = Inner perimeter of concrete or clay masonry 
protection (inches) [see Figure 721.5.1(7)]. 



721.5.1.4.6 Equivalent concrete masonry thick- 
ness. For structural steel columns protected with con- 
crete masonry, Table 721.5.1(5) gives the equivalent 
thickness of concrete masonry required for various 
fire-resistance ratings for typical column shapes. For 
structural steel columns protected with clay masonry. 
Table 721.5.1(6) gives the equivalent thickness of 
concrete masonry required for various fire-resistance 
ratings for typical column shapes. 

721.5.2 Structural steel beams and girders. The 

fire-resistance ratings of steel beams and girders shall be 
based upon the size of the element and the type of protection 
provided in accordance with this section. 

721.5.2.1 Determination of fire resistance. These pro- 
cedures establish a basis for determining resistance of 
structural steel beams and girders which differ in size 
from that specified in approved fire-resistance-rated 
assemblies as a function of the thickness of fire-resistant 
material and the weight (W) and heated perimeter (D) of 
the beam or girder. As used in these sections, W is the 
average weight of a structural steel member in pounds 
per linear foot (plf). The heated perimeter, D, is the inside 
perimeter of the fire-resistant material in inches as illus- 
trated in Figure 721.5.2.

outside dimension of structural tubing column (inches). 
t^^= Thickness of web of wide flange column (inches). 
w = Width of flange of wide flange column (inches). 



721.5.2.1.1 Weight-to-heated perimeter. The 

weight-to-heated-perimeter ratios (W/D), for both 
contour and box fire-resistant protection profiles, for 
the wide flange shapes most often used as beams or 
girders are given in Table 721.5.1(4). For different 
shapes, the weight-to-heated-perimeter ratios (W/D) 
shall be determined in accordance with the definitions 
given in this section. 

721.5.2.1.2 Beam and girder substitutions. Except 
as provided for in Section 721.5.2.2, structural steel 
beams in approved fire-resistance-rated assemblies 
shall be considered the minimum permissible size. 
Other beam or girder shapes shall be permitted to be 
substituted provided that the weight-to-heated-perim- 
eter ratio (W/D) of the substitute beam is equal to or 
greater than that of the beam specified in the approved 
assembly.

2006 INTERNATIONAL BUILDING CODEÂ® 



FIRE-RESISTANCE-RATED CONSTRUCTION 



721.5.2.2 Spray-applied fire-resistant materials. The 

provisions in this section apply to structural steel beams 
and girders protected with spray-applied fire-resistant 
materials. Larger or smaller beam and girder shapes shall 
be permitted to be substituted for beams specified in 
approved unrestrained or restrained fire-resistance-rated 
assemblies, provided the thickness of the fire-resistant 
material is adjusted in accordance with the following 
expression: 

hi = K [(^1 / ^1 ) + 0-60] / [(^2 / Â£&gt;2 ) + 0-60] 



(Equation 7-17) 



where: 



h = Thickness of spray-applied fire-resistant material 
in inches. 

W = Weight of the structural steel beam or girder in 
pounds per linear foot. 

D = Heated perimeter of the structural steel beam in 
inches. 

Subscript 1 refers to the beam and fire-resistant mate- 
rial thickness in the approved assembly. 

Subscript 2 refers to the substitute beam or girder and 
the required thickness of fire-resistant material. 

The fire resistance of structural steel beams and gird- 
ers protected with intumescent or mastic fire-resistant 
coatings shall be determined on the basis of fire-resis- 
tance tests in accordance with Section 703.2. 

721.5.2.2.1 Minimum thicl^ness. The use of Equa- 
tion 7-17 is subject to the following conditions: 

1. The weight-to-heated-perimeter ratio for the 
substitute beam or girder (Wj/Dj) shall not be 
less than 0.37. 

2. The thickness of fire protection materials calcu- 
lated for the substitute beam or girder (Tj) shall 
not be less than Vg inch (9.5 mm). 

3. The unrestrained or restrained beam rating shall 
not be less than 1 hour. 

4i When used to adjust the material thickness for a 
restrained beam, the use of this procedure is 
limited to steel sections classified as compact in 
accordance with the AISC Specification for 
Structural Steel Buildings, (AISC-LRFD). 

721.5.2.3 Structural steel trusses. The fire resistance of 
structural steel trusses protected with fire-resistant mate- 
rials spray-applied to each of the individual truss ele- 
ments shall be permitted to be determined in accordance 
with this section. The thickness of the fire-resistant mate- 
rial shall be determined in accordance with Section 
721.5.1.3. The weight-to-heated-perimeter ratio (W/D) 
of truss elements that can be simultaneously exposed to 
fire on all sides shall be determined on the same basis as 



columns, as specified in Section 721.5.1.1. The 
weight- to-heated-perimeter ratio (WZ)) of truss ele- 
ments that directly support floor or roof construction 
shall be determined on the same basis as beams and gird- 
ers, as specified in Section 721.5.2.1. 

The fire resistance of structural steel trusses protected 
with intumescent or mastic fire-resistant coatings shall 
be determined on the basis of fire-resistance tests in 
accordance with Section 703.2. 

721.6 Wood assemblies. The provisions of this section contain 
procedures by which the fire-resistance ratings of wood assem- 
blies are established by calculations. 

721.6.1 General. This section contains procedures for cal- 
culating the fire-resistance ratings of walls, floor/ceiling 
and roof/ceiling assemblies based in part on the standard 
method of testing referenced in Section 703.2. 

721.6.1.1 Maximum fire-resistance rating. Fire-resis- 
tance ratings calculated using the procedures in this sec- 
tion shall be used only for 1-hour rated assemblies. 

721.6.1.2 Dissimilar membranes. Where dissimilar 
membranes are used on a wall assembly, the calculation 
shall be made from the least fire-resistant (weaker) side. 

721.6.2 Walls, floors and roofs. These procedures apply to 
both load-bearing and nonload-bearing assemblies. 

721.6.2.1 Fire-resistance rating of wood frame assem- 
blies. The fire-resistance rating of a wood frame assem- 
bly is equal to the sum of the time assigned to the 
membrane on the fire-exposed side, the time assigned to 
the framing members and the time assigned for addi- 
tional contribution by other protective measures such as 
insulation. The membrane on the unexposed side shall 
not be included in determining the fire resistance of the 
assembly. 

721.6.2.2 Time assigned to membranes. Table 
721.6.2(1) indicates the time assigned to membranes on 
the fire-exposed side. 

721.6.2.3 Exterior walls. For an exterior wall having 
more than 5 feet ( 1 524 mm) of horizontal separation, the 
wall is assigned a rating dependent on the interior mem- 
brane and the framing as described in Tables 721.6.2(1) 
and 721.6.2(2). The membrane on the outside of the 
nonfire-exposed side of exterior walls having more than 
5 feet (1524 mm) of horizontal separation may consist of 
sheathing, sheathing paper, and siding as described in 
Table 721.6.2(3). 

721.6.2.4 Floors and roofs. In the case of a floor or roof, 
the standard test provides only for testing for fire expo- 
sure from below. Except as noted in Section 703.3, Item 
5, floor or roof assemblies of wood framing shall have an 
upper membrane consisting of a subfloor and finished 
floor conforming to Table 721 .6.2(4) or any other mem- 
brane that has a contribution to fire resistance of at least 
15 minutes in Table 721.6.2(1).

all edges are supported, except Vg-inch Type X gypsum wallboard shall be 
permitted to be installed horizontally with the horizontal joints staggered 24 
inches each side and unsupported but finished. 

c. On wood frame floor/ceiling or roof/ceiling assemblies, gypsurh board shall 
be installed with the long dimension perpendicular to framing members and 
shall have all joints finished. 

d. The membrane on the unexposed side shaU not be included in determining the fire 
resistance of tiie assembly. When dissimilar membranes are used on a wall assem- 
bly, the calculation shall be made from the least fire-resistant (weaker) side. 

e. The time assigned is not a finished rating. 



721.6.2.5 Additional protection. Table 721.6.2(5) indi- 
cates the time increments to be added to the fire resis- 
tance where glass fiber; rockwool, slag mineral wool, or 
cellulose insulation is incorporated in the assembly. 

721.6.2.6 Fastening. Fastening of wood frame assemblies 
and the fastening of membranes to the wood framing 
members shall be done in accordance with Chapter 23. 

721.6.3 Design of fire-resistant exposed wood members. 

The fire-resistance rating, in minutes, of timber beams and 
columns with a minimum nominal dimension of 6 inches 
(152 mm) is equal to: 

Beatns: 2.5AZb [4 -2{b/dy\ for beams which may be 
exposed to fire on four sides. 

(Equation 7-18) 

2.54Z^ [4 -{b/d}] for beams which may be exposed 
to fire on three sides. 

(Equation 7-19) 

Columns: 2.54Z!i [3 -{d/b)] for columns which may be 
exposed to fire on four sides 

(Equation 7-20) 

2.54Zd [3 -(d/2b)] for columns which may be 
exposed to fire on three sides. 

(Equation 7-21) 

where: 

b = The breadth (width) of a beam or larger side of a 
column before exposure to fire (inches). 

d = The depth of a beam or smaller side of a colunm 
before exposure to fire (inches). 

Z = Load factor, based on Figure 721.6.3(1).

SECTION 909 
SMOKE CONTROL SYSTEMS 

[F] 909.1 Scope and purpose. This section applies to mechan- 
ical or passive smoke control systems when they are required 
by other provisions of this code. The purpose of this section is 
to establish minimum requirements for the design, installation 
and acceptance testing of smoke control systems that are 
intended to provide a tenable environment for the evacuation or 
relocation of occupants. These provisions are not intended for 
the preservation of contents, the timely restoration of opera- 
tions or for assistance in fire suppression or overhaul activities. 
Smoke control systems regulated by this section serve a differ- 
ent purpose than the smoke- and heat- venting provisions found 
in Section 910. Mechanical smoke control systems shall not be 
considered exhaust systems under Chapter 5 of the Interna- 
tional Mechanical Code. 

[F] 909.2 General design requirements. Buildings, structures 
or parts thereof required by this code to have a smoke control 
system or systems shall have such systems designed in accor- 
dance with the applicable requirements of Section 909 and the 
generally accepted and well-established principles of engi- 
neering relevant to the design. The construction documents 
shall include sufficient information and detail to adequately 
describe the elements of the design necessary for the proper 
implementation of the smoke control systems. These docu- 
ments shall be accompanied by sufficient information and 
analysis to demonstrate compliance with these provisions. 

[F] 909.3 Special inspection and test requirements. In addi- 
tion to the ordinary inspection and test requirements which 
buildings, structures and parts thereof are required to undergo, 
smoke control systems subject to the provisions of Section 909 
shall undergo special inspections and tests sufficient to verify 
the proper commissioning of the smoke control design in its 
final installed condition. The design submission accompany- 
ing the construction documents shall clearly detail procedures 
and methods to be used and the items subject to such inspec- 
tions and tests. Such commissioning shall be in accordance 
with generally accepted engineering practice and, where possi- 
ble, based on published standards for the particular testing 
involved. The special inspections and tests required by this sec- 
tion shall be conducted under the same terms in Section 1704. 

[F] 909.4 Analysis. A rational analysis supporting the types of 
smoke control systems to be employed, their methods of opera- 
tion, the systems supporting them and the methods of construc- 
tion to be utilized shall accompany the submitted construction 
documents and shall include, but not be limited to, the items 
indicated in Sections 909.4.1 through 909.4.6. 

[F] 909.4.1 Stack effect. The system shall be designed such 
that the maximum probable normal or reverse stack effect 
will not adversely interfere with the system's capabilities. In 
determining the maximum probable stack effect, altitude, 
elevation, weather history and interior temperatures shall be

A/A^ = 0.00050 



A = Total leakage area, square feet (m^). 

Ap = Unit floor or roof area of barrier, square feet (m^). 

Aâ = Unit wall area of barrier, square feet (m^). 

The leakage area ratios shown do not include openings due 
to doors, operable windows or similar gaps. These shall be 
included in calculating the total leakage area. 

[F] 909.5.1 Leakage area. The total leakage area of the bar- 
rier is the product of the smoke barrier gross area multiplied 
by the allowable leakage area ratio, plus the area of other 
openings such as gaps and operable windows. Compliance 
shall be determined by achieving the minimum air pressure 
difference across the barrier with the system in the smoke 
control mode for mechanical smoke control systems. Pas- 
sive smoke control systems tested using other approved 
means such as door fan testing shall be as approved by the 
fire code official.

and air transfer openings are required to be protected 
with a minimum Class II, 250Â°F (121 Â°C) smoke damper 
complying with Section 716. 

[F] 909.6 Pressurization method. The primary mechanical 
means of controlling smoke shall be by pressure differences 
across smoke barriers. Maintenance of a tenable environment 
is not required in the smoke control zone of fire origin. 

[F] 909.6.1 Minimum pressure difference. The minimum 
pressure difference across a smoke barrier shall be 
0.05-inch water gage (0.0124 kPa) in fully sprinklered 
buildings. 

In buildings permitted to be other than fully sprinklered, 
the smoke control system shall be designed to achieve pres- 
sure differences at least two times the maximum calculated 
pressure difference produced by the design fire. 

[F] 909.6.2 Maximum pressure difference. The maxi- 
mum air pressure difference across a smoke barrier shall be 
determined by required door-opening or closing forces. The 
actual force required to open exit doors when the system is 
in the smoke control mode shall be in accordance with Sec- 
tion 1008.1.2. Opening and closing forces for other doors 
shall be determined by standard engineering methods for 
the resolution of forces and reactions. The calculated force 
to set a side-hinged, swinging door in motion shall be deter- 
mined by: 



F=F^,+ K(WAAP)/2(W- d)

SECTION 1004 
OCCUPANT LOAD 

1004.1 Design occupant load. In determining means of egress 
requirements, the number of occupants for whom means of 
egress facilities shall be provided shall be determined in accor- 
dance with this section. Where occupants from accessory areas 
egress through a primary space, the calculated occupant load 
for the primary space shall include the total occupant load of 
the primary space plus the number of occupants egressing 
through it from the accessory area. 

1004.1.1 Areas without fixed seating. The number of 
occupants shall be computed at the rate of one occupant per 
unit of area as prescribed in Table 1004. 1.1. For areas with- 
out fixed seating, the occupant load shall not be less than 
that number determined by dividing the floor area under 
consideration by the occupant per unit of area factor 
assigned to the occupancy as set forth in Table 1004.1.1. 
Where an intended use is not Usted in Table 1004.1.1, the 
building official shall establish a use based on a listed use 
that most nearly resembles the intended use. 

Exception: Where approved by the building official, the 
actual number of occupants for whom each occupied 
space, floor or building is designed, although less than 
those determined by calculation, shall be permitted to be 
used in the determination of the design occupant load. 

1004.2 Increased occupant load. The occupant load permitted in 
any building, or portion thereof, is permitted to be increased from 
that number established for the occupancies in Table 1004.1.1, 
provided that all other requirements of the code are also met 
based on such modified number and the occupant load does not 
exceed one occupant per 7 square feet (0.65 m^) of occupiable 
floor space. Where required by the building official, an approved 
aisle, seating or fixed equipment diagram substantiating any 
increase in occupant load shall be submitted. Where required by 
the building official, such diagram shall be posted. 

1004.3 Posting of occupant load. Every room or space that is 
an assembly occupancy shall have the occupant load of the 
room or space posted in a conspicuous place, near the main exit 
or exit access doorway from the room or space. Posted signs 
shall be of an approved legible permanent design and shall be 
maintained by the owner or authorized agent. 

1004.4 Exiting from multiple levels. Where exits serve more 
than one floor, only the occupant load of each floor considered 
individually shall be used in computing the required capacity 
of the exits at that floor, provided that the exit capacity shall not 
decrease in the direction of egress travel. 

1004.5 Egress convergence. Where means of egress from 
floors above and below converge at an intermediate level, the 
capacity of the means of egress from the point of convergence 
shall not be less than the sum of the two floors.

produced in the members by nominal loads do not exceed spec- 
ified allowable stresses (also called "working stress design"). 

BALCONY, EXTERIOR. An exterior floor projecting from 
and supported by a structure without additional independent 
supports. 

DEAD LOADS. The weight of materials of construction 
incorporated into the building, including but not limited to 
walls, floors, roofs, ceilings, stairways, built-in partitions, fin- 
ishes, cladding and other similarly incorporated architectural 
and structural items, and the weight of fixed service equipment, 
such as cranes, plumbing stacks and risers, electrical feeders,

mit lateral forces to the vertical-resisting elements. When the 
term "diaphragm" is used, it shall include horizontal bracing 
systems. 

Diaphragm, blocked. In light-frame construction, a dia- 
phragm in which all sheathing edges not occurring on a 
framing member are supported on and fastened to blocking.

tion where shear is transferred into or out of the diaphragm 
sheathing. Transfer is either to a boundary element or to 
another force-resisting element. 

Diaphragm chord. A diaphragm boundary element per- 
pendicular to the applied load that is assumed to take axial 
stresses due to the diaphragm moment. 

Diaphragm flexible. A diaphragm is flexible for the pur- 
pose of distribution of story shear and torsional moment 
where so indicated in Section 12.3. 1 of ASCE 7, as modified 
in Section 1613.6.1. 



Diaphragm, rigid. A diaphragm is rigid for the purpose of 
distribution of story shear and torsional moment when the 
lateral deformation of the diaphragm is less than or equal to 
two times the average story drift. 

DURATION OF LOAD. The period of continuous appUca- 
tion of a given load, or the aggregate of periods of intermittent 
applications of the same load. 

ESSENTIAL FACILITIES. Buildings and other structures 
that are intended to remain operational in the event of extreme 
environmental loading from flood, wind, snow or earthquakes. 

FABRIC PARTITIONS. A partition consisting of a finished 
surface made of fabric, without a continuous rigid backing, that 
is directly attached to a framing system in which the vertical

elevators, craneways, vehicles and other similar forces and 
kinetic loads, pressure and possible surcharge from fixed or 
moving loads. 

LIMIT STATE. A condition beyond which a structure or 
member becomes unfit for service and is judged to be no longer 
useful for its intended function (serviceability limit state) or to 
be unsafe (strength limit state). 

LIVE LOADS. Those loads produced by the use and occu- 
pancy of the building or other structure and do not include con- 
struction or environmental loads such as wind load, snow load, 
rain load, earthquake load, flood load or dead load. 

LIVE LOADS (ROOF). Those loads produced (1) during 
maintenance by workers, equipment and materials; and (2) 
during the life of the structure by movable objects such as 
planters and by people. 

LOAD AND RESISTANCE FACTOR DESIGN (LRFD). A 

method of proportioning structural members and their connec- 
tions using load and resistance factors such that no applicable 
limit state is reached when the structure is subjected to appro- 
priate load combinations. The term "LRFD" is used in the 
design of steel and wood structures. 

LOAD EFFECTS. Forces and deformations produced in 
structural members by the applied loads. 

LOAD FACTOR. A factor that accounts for deviations of the 
actual load from the nominal load, for uncertainties in the anal- 
ysis that transforms the load into a load effect, and for the prob- 
ability that more than one extreme load will occur 
simultaneously. 

LOADS. Forces or other actions that result from the weight of 
building materials, occupants and their possessions, environ-

tions of the actual strength from the nominal strength and the 
manner and consequences of failure (also called "strength 
reduction factor"). 

STRENGTH, NOMINAL. The capacity of a structure or 
member to resist the effects of loads, as determined by compu- 
tations using specified material strengths and dimensions and 
equations derived from accepted principles of structural 
mechanics or by field tests or laboratory tests of scaled models, 
allowing for modeling effects and differences between labora- 
tory and field conditions. 

STRENGTH, REQUIRED. Strength of a member, cross sec- 
tion or connection required to resist factored loads or related 
internal moments and forces in such combinations as stipulated 
by these provisions. 

STRENGTH DESIGN. A method of proportioning structural 
members such that the computed forces produced in the mem- 
bers by factored loads do not exceed the member design 
strength [also called "load and resistance factor design" 
(LRFD)]. The term "strength design" is used in the design of 
concrete and masonry structural elements.

a. For structural roofing and siding made of formed metal sheets, the total load 
deflection shall not exceed //60. For secondary roof structural members sup- 
porting formed metal roofing, the five load deflection shall not exceed //1 50. 
For secondary wall members supporting formed metal siding, the design 
wind load deflection shall not exceed //90. For roofs, this exception only 
appUes when the metal sheets have no roof covering. 

b. Interior partitions not exceeding 6 feet in height and flexible, folding and 
portable partitions are not governed by the provisions of this section. The 
deflection criterion for interior partitions is based on the horizontal load 
defined in Section 1607.13. 

c. See Section 2403 for glass supports. 

d. For wood structural members having a moisture content of less than 16 per- 
cent at time of installation and used under dry conditions, the deflection 
resulting from L + 0.5D is permitted to be substituted for the deflection 
resulting from L + D. 

e. The above deflections do not ensure against ponding. Roofs that do not have 
sufficient slope or camber to assure adequate drainage shall be investigated 
for ponding. See Section 161 1 for rain and ponding requirements and Sec- 
tion 1503.4 for roof drainage requirements. 

f . The wind load is permitted to be taken as 0.7 times the "component and clad- 
ding" loads for the purpose of determining deflection hmits herein. 

g. For steel structural members, the dead load shall be taten as zero. 

h. For aluminum structural members or aluminum panels used in skylights and 
sloped glazing framing, roofs or walls of sunroom additions or patio covers, 
not supporting edge of glass or aluminum sandwich panels, the total load 
deflection shall not exceed Vgp. For aluminum sandwich panels used in roofs 
or walls of sunroom additions or patio covers, the total load deflection shall 
not exceed V120. 

i. For cantilever members, / shall be taken as twice the length of the cantilever. 



1604.3.3 Steel. The deflection of steel structural members 
shall not exceed that permitted by AISC 360, AISI-NAS, 
AISI-General, AISI-Truss, ASCE 3, ASCE 8, SJI JG-1.1, 
SJI K-1.1 or SJI LH/DLH-1.1, as applicable. 

1604.3.4 Masonry. The deflection of masonry structural 
members shall not exceed that permitted by ACI 530/ASCE 
5/TMS 402. 

1604.3.5 Aluminum. The deflection of aluminum struc- 
tural members shall not exceed that permitted by AA 
ADMl. 

1604.3.6 Limits. Deflection of structural members over 
span, /, shall not exceed that permitted by Table 1604.3. 



1604.4 Analysis. Load effects on structural members and their 
connections shall be determined by methods of structural anal- 
ysis that take into account equilibrium, general stability, geo- 
metric compatibility and both short- and long-term material 
properties. 

Members that tend to accumulate residual deformations 
under repeated service loads shall have included in their analy- 
sis the added eccentricities expected to occur during their ser- 
vice life. 

Any system or method of construction to be used shaU be 
based on a rational analysis in accordance with well-estabUshed 
principles of mechanics. Such analysis shall result in a system 
that provides a complete load path capable of transferring loads 
from their point of origin to the load-resisting elements. 

The total lateral force shall be distributed to the various verti- 
cal elements of the lateral-force-resisting system in proportion 
to their rigidities, considering the rigidity of the horizontal 
bracing system or diaphragm. Rigid elements assumed not to 
be a part of the lateral-force-resisting system are permitted to 
be incorporated into buildings provided their effect on the 
action of the system is considered and provided for in the 
design. Except where diaphragms are flexible, or are permitted 
to be analyzed as flexible, provisions shall be made for the 
increased forces induced on resisting elements of the structural 
system resulting from torsion due to eccentricity between the 
center of application of the lateral forces and the center of rigid- 
ity of the lateral-force-resisting system. 

Every structure shall be designed to resist the overturning 
effects caused by the lateral forces specified in this chapter. See 
Section 1609 for wind loads, Section 1610 for lateral soil loads 
and Section 1613 for earthquake loads. 

1604.5 Occupancy category. Buildings shall be assigned an 
occupancy category in accordance with Table 1604.5. 

1604.5.1 Multiple occupancies. Where a structure is occu- 
pied by two or more occupancies not included in the same 
occupancy category, the structure shall be assigned the clas- 
sification of the highest occupancy category corresponding 
to the various occupancies. Where structures have two or 
more portions that are structurally separated, each portion 
shall be separately classified. Where a separated portion of a 
structure provides required access to, required egress from 
or shares life safety components with another portion hav- 
ing a higher occupancy category, both portions shall be 
assigned to the higher occupancy category. 

1604.6 In-situ load tests. The building official is authorized to 
require an engineering analysis or a load test, or both, of any 
construction whenever there is reason to question the safety of 
the construction for the intended occupancy. Engineering anal- 
ysis and load tests shall be conducted in accordance with Sec- 
tion 1713. 

1604.7 Preconstruction load tests. Materials and methods of 
construction that are not capable of being designed by 
approved engineering analysis or that do not comply with the 
applicable material design standards listed in Chapter 35, or 
alternative test procedures in accordance with Section 1711, 
shall be load tested in accordance with Section 1714.

1604.8 Anchorage. 

1604.8.1 General. Anchorage of the roof to walls and col- 
umns, and of walls and columns to foundations, shall be 
provided to resist the upUft and sliding forces that result 
from the application of the prescribed loads. 

1604.8.2 Concrete and masonry walls. Concrete and 
masonry walls shall be anchored to floors, roofs and other 
structural elements that provide lateral support for the wall. 
Such anchorage shall provide a positive direct connection 
capable of resisting the horizontal forces specified in this 
chapter but not less than a minimum strength design hori- 
zontal force of 280 plf (4.10 kN/m) of wall, substituted for 
"Â£" in the load combinations of Section 1605.2 or 1605.3. 
Walls shall be designed to resist bending between anchors 
where the anchor spacing exceeds 4 feet (1219 mm). 
Required anchors in masonry walls of hollow units or cavity 
walls shall be embedded in a reinforced grouted structural 
element of the wall. See Sections 1609 for wind design 
requirements and see Section 1613 for earthquake design 
requirements. 

1604.8.3 Decks. Where supported by attachment to an exterior 
wall, decks shall be positively anchored to the primary struc- 
ture and designed for both vertical and lateral loads as applica- 
ble. Such attachment shall not be accompUshed by the use of 
toenails or nails subject to withdrawal. Where positive connec- 
tion to the primary building structure cannot be verified during 
inspection, decks shall be self-supporting. For decks with can- 
tilevered framing members, connections to exterior walls or 
other framing members shall be designed and constructed to 
resist uplift resulting from the fuU live load specified in Table 
1607. 1 acting on the cantilevered portion of the deck. 

1604.9 Counteracting structural actions. Structural mem- 
bers, systems, components and cladding shall be designed to 
resist forces due to earthquake and wind, with consideration of 
overturning, sliding, and uplift. Continuous load paths shall be 
provided for transmitting these forces to the foundation. Where 
shding is used to isolate the elements, the effects of friction 
between sliding elements shall be included as a force. 

1604.10 Wind and seismic detailing. Lateral-force-resisting 
systems shall meet seismic detaiUng requirements and limita- 
tions prescribed in this code and ASCE 7, excluding Chapter 
14 and Appendix 11 A, even when wind code prescribed load 
effects are greater than seismic load effects. 

SECTION 1605 
LOAD COMBINATIONS 

1605.1 General. Buildings and other structures and portions 
thereof shall be designed to resist the load combinations speci- 
fied in Section 1605.2 or 1605.3 and Chapters 18 through 23, 
and the special seismic load combinations of Section 1605.4 
where required by Section 12.3.3.3 or 12.10.2.1 of ASCE 7. 
Applicable loads shall be considered, including both earth- 
quake and wind, in accordance with the specified load combi- 
nations. Each load combination shall also be investigated with 
one or more of the variable loads set to zero. 

1605.2 Load combinations using strength design or load 
and resistance factor design. 



1605.2.1 Basic load combinations. Where strength design 
or load and resistance factor design is used, structures and 
portions thereof shall resist the most critical effects from the 
following combinations of factored loads: 



IA(D + F) 

l.2(D + F+T) + 1.6(L + H) + 
0.5(L,orSor/?)

/i = 1 for floors in places of public assembly, for live loads 
in excess of 100 pounds per square foot (4.79 kN/m^), 
and for parking garage live load, and 

= 0.5 for other live loads. 

/2 = 0.7 for roof configurations (such as saw tooth) that do 
not shed snow off the structure, and 

= 0.2 for other roof configurations. 

Exception: Where other factored load combinations are 
specifically required by the provisions of this code, such 
combinations shall take precedence. 

1605.2.2 Other loads. Where F^ is to be considered in the 
design, the load combinations of Section 2.3.3 of ASCE 7 
shall be used. 

1605.3 Load combinations using allowable stress design. 

1605.3.1 Basic load combinations. Where allowable stress 
design (working sttess design), as permitted by this code, is 
used, structures and portions thereof shall resist the most 
critical effects resulting from the following combinations of

Exceptions: 

1 . Crane hook loads need not be combined with roof 
live load or with more than three-fourths of the 
snow load or. one-half of the wind load. 

2. Flat roof snow loads of 30 psf ( 1 .44 kN/m^) or less 
need not be combined with seismic loads. Where 



282

STRUCTURAL DESIGN 



flat roof snow loads exceed 30 psf (1.44 kN/m^), 
20 percent shall be combined with seismic loads. 

1605.3.1.1 Stress increases. Increases in allowable 
stresses specified in the appropriate material chapter or 
the referenced standards shall not be used with the load 
combinations of Section 1605.3. 1 , except that a duration 
of load increase shall be permitted in accordance with 
Chapter 23. 

1605.3.1.2 Other loads. Where F^ is to be considered in 
design, the load combinations of Section 2.4.2 of ASCE 
7 shall be used. 

1605.3.2 Alternative basic load combinations. In lieu of the 
basic load combinations specified in Section 1605.3.1, struc- 
tures and portions thereof shall be permitted to be designed for 
the most critical effects resulting from the following combina- 
tions. When using these alternative basic load combinations 
that include wind or seismic loads, allowable stresses are per- 
mitted to be increased or load combinations reduced where 
permitted by the material chapter of this code or the referenced 
standards. For load combinations that include the counteract- 
ing effects of dead and wind loads, only two-thirds of the mini- 
mum dead load likely to be in place during a design wind event 
shall be used. Where wind loads are calculated in accordance 
with Chapter 6 of ASCE 7, the coefficient (o in the following 
equations shall be taken as 1 .3. For other wind loads, (o shall be 
taken as 1. When using these alternative load combinations to 
evaluate sliding, overturning and soil bearing at the soil-struc- 
ture interface, the reduction of foundation overturning from 
Section 12. 13.4 in ASCE 7 shall not be used. When using these 
alternative basic load combinations for proportioning founda- 
tions for loadings, which include seismic loads, the vertical 
seismic load effect, E^, in Equation 12.4-4 of ASCE 7 is permit- 
ted to be taken equal to zero.

sidered in the design, each apphcable load shall be added 
to the combinations specified in Section 1605.3.2. 

1605.4 Special seismic load combinations. For both allow- 
able stress design and strength design methods where specifi- 
cally required by Section 1605. 1 or by Chapters 18 through 23, 



elements and components shall be designed to resist the forces 
calculated using Equation 16-22 when the effects of the seis- 
mic ground motion are additive to gravity forces and those cal- 
culated using Equation 16-23 when the effects of the seismic 
ground motion counteract gravity forces.

where on the landing area (representing the helicopter's 
two main landing gear, whether skid type or wheeled 
type), having a magnitude of 0.75 times the gross weight 
of the helicopter. Both loads acting together total 
one-and one half times the gross weight of the helicopter. 

3. Dead load, D, plus a uniform live load, L, of 100 psf (4.79 
kN/m^). 

Exception: Landing areas designed for helicopters 
with gross weights not exceeding 3,000 pounds 
(13.34 kN) in accordance with Items 1 and 2 shall be 
permitted to be designed using a 40 psf (1.92 kN/m^) 
uniform live load in Item 3, provided the landing area 
is identified with a 3,000 pound (13.34 kN) weight 
limitation. This 40 psf ( 1 .92 kN/m^) uniform live load 
shall not be reduced. The landing area weight limita- 
tion shall be indicated by the numeral "3" (kips) 
located in the bottom right comer of the landing area

SECTION 1607 
LIVE LOADS 

1607.1 GeneraL Live loads are those loads defined in Section 
1602.1. 

1607.2 Loads not specified. For occupancies or uses not des- 
ignated in Table 1607.1, the live load shall be determined in 
accordance with a method approved by the building official. 

1607.3 Uniform live loads. The live loads used in the design of 
buildings and other structures shall be the maximum loads 
expected by the intended use or occupancy but shall in no case 
be less than the minimum uniformly distributed unit loads 
required by Table 1 607 . 1 . 

1607.4 Concentrated loads. Floors and other similar surfaces 
shall be designed to support the uniformly distributed live 
loads prescribed in Section 1607.3 or the concentrated load, in 
pounds (kilonewtons), given in Table 1607.1, whichever pro- 
duces the greater load effects. Unless otherwise specified, the 
indicated concentration shall be assumed to be uniformly dis- 
tributed over an area 2.5 feet by 2.5 feet [6.25 square feet (0.58 
m^)] and shall be located so as to produce the maximum load 
effects in the structural members. 

1607.5 Partition loads. In office buildings and in other build- 
ings where partition locations are subject to change, provisions 
for partition weight shall be made, whether or not partitions are 
shown on the construction documents, unless the specified live 
load exceeds 80 psf (3.83 kN/m^). The partition load shall not 
be less than a uniformly distributed live load of 15 psf (0.74 
kN/m2). 

1607.6 Truck and bus garages. Minimum live loads for 
garages having trucks or buses shall be as specified in Table 
1607.6, but shall not be less than,50 psf (2.40 kN/m^), unless 
other loads are specifically justified and approved by the build- 
ing official. Actual loads shall be used where they are greater 
than the loads specified in the table.

b. See Section 1607.6.1 for the loading of multiple spans. 

1607.6.1 Truck and bus garage live load application. The 

concentrated load and uniform load shall be uniformly dis- 
tributed over a 10-foot (3048 mm) width on a line normal to 
the centerline of the lane placed within a 12-foot- wide 
(3658 mm) lane. The loads shall be placed within their indi- 



vidual lanes so as to produce the maximum stress in each 
structural member. Single spans shall be designed for the 
uniform load in Table 1607.6 and one simultaneous concen- 
trated load positioned to produce the maximum effect. Mul- 
tiple spans shall be designed for the uniform load in Table 
1607.6 on the spans and two simultaneous concentrated 
loads in two spans positioned to produce the maximum neg- 
ative moment effect. Multiple span design loads, for other 
effects, shall be the same as for single spans. 

1607.7 Loads on handrails, guards, grab bars and vehicle 
barriers. Handrails, guards, grab bars as designed in ICC 
Al 17.1 and vehicle barriers shall be designed and constructed 
to the structural loading conditions set forth in this section. 

1607.7.1 Handrails and guards. Handrail assemblies and 
guards shall be designed to resist a load of 50 plf (0.73 
kN/m) applied in any direction at the top and to transfer this 
load through the supports to the structure. Glass handrail 
assemblies and guards shall also comply with Section 2407. 

Exceptions: 

1 . For one- and two-family dwellings, only the single 
concentrated load required by Section 1607.7.1.1 
shall be applied. 

2. In Group 1-3, F, H and S occupancies, for areas that 
are not accessible to the general public and that 
have an occupant load less than 50, the minimum 
load shall be 20 pounds per foot (0.29 kN/m). 

1607.7.1.1 Concentrated load. Handrail assemblies 
and guards shall be able to resist a single concentrated 
load of 200 pounds (0.89 kN), applied in any direction at 
any point along the top, and have attachment devices and 
supporting structure to transfer this loading to appropri- 
ate structural elements of the building. This load need not 
be assumed to act concurrently with the loads specified 
in the preceding paragraph. 

1607.7.1.2 Components. Intermediate rails (all those 
except the handrail), balusters and panel fillers shall be 
designed to withstand a horizontally applied normal load 
of 50 pounds (0.22 kN) on an area equal to 1 square foot 
(0.093m2), including openings and space between rails. 
Reactions due to this loading are not required to be 
superimposed with those of Section 1607.7.1 or 
1607.7.1.1. 

1607.7.1.3 Stress increase. Where handrails and guards 
are designed in accordance with the provisions for allow- 
able stress design (working stress design) exclusively for 
the loads specified in Section 1607.7.1, the allowable 
stress for the members and their attachments are permit- 
ted to be increased by one-third. 

1607.7.2 Grab bars, shower seats and dressing room 
bench seats. Grab bars, shower seats and dressing room 
bench seat systems shall be designed to resist a single con- 
centrated load of 250 pounds (1.11 kN) applied in any direc- 
tion at any point.

a. Floors in garages or portions of buildings used for the storage of motor vehi- 
cles shall be designed for the uniformly distributed live loads of Table 
1607.1 or the following concentrated loads: (1) for garages restricted to 
vehicles accommodating not more than nine passengers, 3,000 pounds act- 
ing on an area of 4.5 inches by 4.5 inches; (2) for mechanical parking struc- 
tures without slab or deck which are used for storing passenger vehicles 
only, 2,250 pounds per wheel. 

b. The loading applies to stack room floors that support nonmobile, dou- 
ble-faced hbrary bookstacks, subject to the following limitations: 

1. The nominal bookstack unit height shall not exceed 90 inches; 

2. The nominal shelf depth shall not exceed 1 2 inches for each face; and 

3. Parallel rows of double-faced bookstacks shall be separated by aisles

Telescopic Seating and Grandstands. 

d. Other uniform loads in accordance with an approved method which contains 
provisions for truck loadings shall also be considered where appropriate. 

e. The concentrated wheel load shall be applied on an area of 20 square inches. 

f. Minimum concentrated load on stair treads (on area of 4 square inches) is 
300 pounds. 



g. Where snow loads occur that are in excess of the design conditions, the 
structure shall be designed to support the loads due to the increased loads 
caused by drift buildup or a greater snow design determined by the building 
official (see Section 1608). For special-purpose roofs, see Section 
1607.11.2.2. 

h. See Section 1604.8.3 for decks attached to exterior walls. 

i. Attics without storage are those where the maximum clear height between

adjacent trusses with the same web configuration capable of containing a 
rectangle 42 inches high by 2 feet wide, or greater, located within the plane 
of the truss. For attics without storage, this Uve load need not be assumed to 
act concurrently with any other Uve load requirements. 

j. For attics with limited storage and constructed with trusses, this live load 
need only be applied to those portions of the bottom chord where there are 
two or more adjacent trusses with the same web configuration capable of 
containing a rectangle 42 inches high by 2 feet wide or greater, located 
within the plane of the truss. The rectangle shall fit between the top of the 
bottom chord and the bottom of any other truss member, provided that each 
of the following criteria is met: 

i. The attic area is accessible by a pull-down stairway or framed opening 

in accordance with Section 1209.2, and 
ii. The truss shall have a bottom chord pitch less than 2:12.

senger cars shall be designed to resist a single load of 6,000 
pounds (26.70 kN) applied horizontally in any direction to 
the barrier system and shall have anchorage or attachment 
capable of transmitting this load to the structure. For design 
of the system, the load shall be assumed to act at a minimum 
height of 1 foot, 6 inches (457 mm) above the floor or ramp 
surface on an area not to exceed 1 square foot (305 mm^), 
and is not required to be assumed to act concurrently with 
any handraolil or guard loadings specified in the preceding 
paragraphs of Section 1607.7.1. Garages accommodating 
trucks and buses shall be designed in accordance with an 
approved method that contains provision for traffic railings. 

1607.8 Impact loads. The live loads specified in Section 
1607.3 include allowance for impact conditions. Provisions 
shall be made in the structural design for uses and loads that 
involve unusual vibration and impact forces. 

1607.8.1 Elevators. Elevator loads shall be increased by 
100 percent for impact and the structural supports shall be 
designed within the limits of deflection prescribed by 
ASMEA17.1. 

1607.8.2 Machinery. For the purpose of design, the weight 
of machinery and moving loads shall be increased as fol- 
lows to allow for impact: (1) elevator machinery, 100 per- 
cent; (2) hght machinery, shaft- or motor-driven, 20 percent; 
(3) reciprocating machinery or power-driven units, 50 per- 
cent; (4) hangers for floors or balconies, 33 percent. Per- 
centages shall be increased where specified by the 
manufacturer. 



1607.9 Reduction in live loads. Except for roof uniform hve I 
loads, all other minimum uniformly distributed live loads, L^, | 
in Table 1607. 1 are permitted to be reduced in accordance with

STRUCTURAL DESIGN 



1607.10 Distribution of floor loads. Where uniform floor live 
loads are involved in the design of structural members arranged 
so as to create continuity, the minimum applied loads shall be 
the full dead loads on all spans in combination with the floor 
live loads on spans selected to produce the greatest effect at 
each location under consideration. It shall be permitted to 
reduce floor live loads in accordance with Section 1607.9. 

1607.11 Roof loads. The structural supports of roofs and mar- 
quees shall be designed to resist wind and, where applicable, 
snow and earthquake loads, in addition to the dead load of con- 
struction and the appropriate live loads as prescribed in this 
section, or as set forth in Table 1607. 1 . The live loads acting on 
a sloping surface shall be assumed to act vertically on the hori- 
zontal projection of that surface. 

1607.11.1 Distribution of roof loads. Where uniform roof 
live loads are reduced to less than 20 psf (0.96 kN/m^) in 
accordance with Section 1 607 .11.2.1 and are involved in the 
design of structural members arranged so as to create conti- 
nuity, the minimum applied loads shall be the full dead loads 
on all spans in combination with the roof live loads on adja- 
cent spans or on alternate spans, whichever produces the 
greatest effect. See Section 1607.11.2 for minimum roof 
live loads and Section 7.5 of ASCE 7 for partial snow load- 
ing. 

1607.11.2 Reduction in roof live loads. The minimum uni- 
formly distributed roof Uve loads, Lâ, in Table 1607. 1 are per- 
mitted to be reduced according to the following provisions. 

1607.11.2.1 Flat, pitched and curved roofs. Ordinary 
flat, pitched and curved roofs are permitted to be 
designed for a reduced roof live load as specified in the 
following equation or other controlling combinations of 
loads in Section 1605, whichever produces the greater 
load. In structures where special scaffolding is used as a 
work surface for workers and materials during mainte- 
nance and repair operations, a lower roof load than speci- 
fied in the following equation shall not be used unless 
approved by the building official. Greenhouses shall be 
designed for a minimum roof live load of 12 psf (0.58 
kN/m2). 

L, = 4 RjR2 (Equation 16-27)

1607.11.2.2 Special-purpose roofs. Roofs used for 
promenade purposes, roof gardens, assembly purposes 
or other special purposes shall be designed for a mini- 
mum live load as required in Table 1607. 1 . Such roof live 
loads are permitted to be reduced in accordance with 
1607.9. 

1607.11.2.3 Landscaped roofs. Where roofs are to be 
landscaped, the uniform design live load in the land- 
scaped area shall be 20 psf (0.958 kN/m^). The weight of 
the landscaping materials shall be considered as dead 
load and shall be computed on the basis of saturation of 
the soil. 

1607.11.2.4 Awnings and canopies. Awnings and cano- 
pies shall be designed for uniform live loads as required I 
in Table 1607. 1 as well as for snow loads and wind loads | 
as specified in Sections 1608 and 1609. 

1607.12 Crane loads. The crane live load shall be the rated 
capacity of the crane. Design loads for the runway beams, 
including connections and support brackets, of moving bridge 
cranes and monorail cranes shall include the maximum wheel 
loads of the crane and the vertical impact, lateral and longitudi- 
nal forces induced by the moving crane. 

1607.12.1 Maximum wheel load. The maximum wheel 
loads shall be the wheel loads produced by the weight of the 
bridge, as applicable, plus the sum of the rated capacity and 
the weight of the trolley with the trolley positioned on its 
runway at the location where the resulting load effect is 
maximum. 

1607.12.2 Vertical impact force. The maximum wheel 
loads of the crane shall be increased by the percentages 
shown below to determine the induced vertical impact or 
vibration force:

STRUCTURAL DESIGN 



1607.12.3 Lateral force. The lateral force on crane runway 
beams with electrically powered trolleys shall be calculated 
as 20 percent of the sum of the rated capacity of the crane 
and the weight of the hoist and trolley. The lateral force shall 
be assumed to act horizontally at the traction surface of a 
runway beam, in either direction perpendicular to the beam, 
and shall be distributed according to the lateral stiffness of 
the runway beam and supporting structure. 

1607.12.4 Longitudinal force. The longitudinal force on 
crane runway beams, except for bridge cranes with 
hand-geared bridges, shall be calculated as 10 percent of the 
maximum wheel loads of the crane. The longitudinal force 
shall be assumed to act horizontally at the traction surface of 
a runway beam, in either direction parallel to the beam. 

1607.13 Interior walls and partitions. Interior walls and par- 
titions that exceed 6 feet (1829 mm) in height, including their 
finish materials, shall have adequate strength to resist the loads 
to which they are subjected but not less than a horizontal load of 

5psf(0.240kN/m2). 

Exception: Fabric partitions complying with Section 
1607. 13. 1 shall not be required to resist the minimum hori- 
zontal load of 5 psf (0.24 kN/m^). 

1607.13.1 Fabric partitions. Fabric partitions that exceed 6 
feet (1829 mm) in height, including their finish materials, 
shall have adequate strength to resist the following load con- 
ditions: 

1. A horizontal distributed load of 5 psf (0.24 kN/m^) 
applied to the partition framing. The total area used to 
determine the distributed load shall be the area of the 
fabric face between the framing members to which 
the fabric is attached. The total distributed load shall 
be uniformly applied to such framing members in 
proportion to the length of each member. 



2. A concentrated load of 40 pounds (0.176 kN) applied 
to an 8-inch diameter (203 mm) area [50.3 square 
inches (32 452 mm^)] of the fabric face at a height of 
54 inches (1372 mm) above the floor. 



SECTION 1608 
SNOW LOADS 

1608.1 General. Design snow loads shall be determined in 
accordance with Chapter 7 of ASCE 7, but the design roof load 
shall not be less than that determined by Section 1607. 

1608.2 Ground snow loads. The ground snow loads to be used 
in determining the design snow loads for roofs shall be deter- 
mined in accordance with ASCE 7 or Figure 1608.2 for the 
contiguous United States and Table 1608.2 for Alaska. 
Site-specific case studies shall be made in areas designated 
"CS" in Figure 1608.2. Ground snow loads for sites at eleva- 
tions above the limits indicated in Figure 1608.2 and for all 
sites within the CS areas shall be approved. Ground snow load 
determination for such sites shall be based on an extreme value 
statistical analysis of data available in the vicinity of the site 
using a value with a 2-percent annual probabiUty of being 
exceeded (50-year mean recurrence interval). Snow loads are 
zero for Hawaii, except in mountainous regions as approved by 
the building official. 



SECTION 1609 
WIND LOADS 

1609.1 Applications. Buildings, structures and parts thereof 
shall be designed to withstand the minimum wind loads pre- 
scribed herein. Decreases in wind loads shall not be made for 
the effect of shielding by other structures.

dance with Section 6.5.4 of ASCE 7. 

In nonhurricane-prone regions, when the basic wind speed is 
estimated from regional climatic data, the basic wind speed 
shall be not less than the wind speed associated with an annual 
probability of 0.02 (50-year mean recurrence interval), and the 
estimate shall be adjusted for equivalence to a 3-second gust 
wind speed at 33 feet (10 m) above ground in Exposure Cate- 
gory C. The data analysis shall be performed in accordance 
with Section 6.5.4.2 of ASCE 7.

tance of at least 2,600 feet (792 m) or 20 times the height 
of the building, whichever is greater. 

Exception: For buildings whose mean roof height is 
less than or equal to 30 feet (9144 mm), tiie upwind dis- 
tance is permitted to be reduced to 1,500 feet (457 m). 

Exposure C. Exposure C shall apply for all cases where 
Exposures B or D do not apply. 

Exposure D. Exposure D shall apply where the ground 
surface roughness, as defined by Surface Roughness D, 
prevails in the upwind direction for a distance of at least 
5,000 feet (1524 m) or 20 times the height of the build- 
ing, whichever is greater. Exposure D shall extend inland 
from the shoreline for a distance of 600 feet (183 m) or 20 
times the height of the building, whichever is greater.

Lift coefficient. The lift coefficient for concrete and 
clay tile shall be 0.2 or shall be determined by test in 
accordance with Section 1715.2. 

GCp = Roof pressure coefficient for each applicable roof 
zone determined from Chapter 6 of ASCE 7. Roof 
coefficients shall not be adjusted for internal pres- 
sure, r 

L = Length, feet (mm) of the roof tile. 

Lâ = Moment arm, feet (nun) fi*om the axis of rotation to 
the point of uplift on the roof tile. The point of uplift 
shall be taken at 0.76L from the head of the tile and 
the middle of the exposed width. For roof tiles with 
nails or screws (with or without a tail clip), the axis 
of rotation shall be taken as the head of the tile for 
direct deck application or as the top edge of the bat- 
ten for battened applications. For roof tiles fastened 
only by a nail or screw along the side of the tile, the 
axis of rotation shall be determined by testing. For 
roof tiles installed with battens and fastened only by 
a clip near the tail of the tile, the moment arm shall 
be determined about the top edge of the batten with 
consideration given for the point of rotation of the 
tiles based on straight bond or broken bond and the 
tile profile.

Class C. 

The hard rock category. Site Class A, shall be supported 
by shear wave velocity measurements either on site or on

equal or greater degree of weathering and fracturing. Where 
hard rock conditions are known to be continuous to a depth 
of 100 feet (30 480 mm), surficial shear wave velocityjnea-

used if there is more than 10 feet (3048 mm) of soil between 
the rock surface and the bottom of the spread footing or mat 
foundation. 

1613.5.5.1 Steps for classifying a site. 

1 . Check for the four categories of Site Class F requir- 
ing site-specific evaluation. If the site corresponds 
to any of these categories, classify the site as Site 
Class F and conduct a site-specific evaluation. 

2. Check for the existence of a total thickness of soft 
clay &gt; 10 feet (3048 mm) where a soft clay layer is 
defined by: 5â &lt; 500 psf (24 kPa), w &gt; 40 percent

DISCUSSION 

The acceleration values contoured on this map are for the random horizontal 
conqnnent of acceleration For design purposes, the reference site condition 
fin- ^ map is to be talxn as Site Class B. 

The two areas shown as zone boundaries are the ^mjection to the earth' s 
surface ofhorizontal rupture planes at 9 km depth Spectral accelerations 
are constant within the bouniiries of the zones. The number on the boundary 
and inside the zone is the median spectral response acceleration times 1 .5. 

Leyendecker, fiankel, and Rukstales (2001 , 2004) have prepared a CD-ROM 
that contains software to allow determination of Site Class B map values by 
latitude-longitude. The software on the CD contains site coefficients that 
allow the user to adjust map values for different Site Classes. Additional 
maps at different scales are also included on the CD. The CD was prepoied 
using the same data as diat used to prepare the Maximum Considered Earthqualoe 
Ground Motion maps.

httpc//eqhazmaps. usgs.gov, contains electronic versions of this map 
and others. Documentation, ^dded values, and Arc/INPO coverages used 
to make the maps are also available.

The acceleration values contoured on this map are for the random hoiizontal 
con^onentofacceleratioa Jwdesignpuiposes, the reference site condition 
for the map is to be taken as Site Class B. 

Leyendecker, Fiankel, and Rukstales (2001 , 2004) have prepared a CD-ROM 
that contains software to allow determination of Site Class B map values by 
latitude-longitude. The software on the CD contains site coefBcients that 
allow the user to adjust map values for different Site Classes Additional maps 
at different scales are also included on the CD. The CD was prepared using tte 
same data as that used to prepare the Maximum Considered Eaitiiquake Ground 
Motion maps. 

The National Seismic Hazard Mapping Project Web Site, 
fe^r/feghazmaps. usgs.gov, contains electronic versions of this map 
and others. Documentation, ^dded values, and Aic/INPO coverages used 
to mate the maps are also available.

1704.3.3.1 General. While the work is in progress, the 
special inspector shall determine that the requirements 
for bolts, nuts, washers and paint; bolted parts and instal- 
lation and tightening in such standards are met. For bolts 
requiring pretensioning, the special inspector shall 
observe the preinstallation testing and calibration proce- 
dures when such procedures are required by the installa- 
tion method or by project plans or specifications; 
determine that all plies of connected materials have been 
drawn together and properly snugged and monitor the 
installation of bolts to verify that the selected procedure 
for installation is properly used to tighten bolts. For 
joints required to be tightened only to the snug-tight con- 
dition, the special inspector need only verify that the con- 
nected materials have been drawn together and properly 
snugged. 

1704.3.3.2 Periodic monitoring. Monitoring of bolt 
installation for pretensioning is permitted to be per- 



formed on a periodic basis when using the tum-of-nut 
method with matchmarking techniques, the direct ten- 
sion indicator method or the alternate design fastener 
(twist-off bolt) method. Joints designated as snug tight 
need be inspected only on a periodic basis. 

1704.3.3.3 Continuous monitoring. Monitoring of bolt 
installation for pretensioning using the calibrated 
wrench method or the tum-of-nut method without 
matchmarking shall be performed on a continuous basis. 

1704.4 Concrete construction. The special inspections and 
verifications for concrete construction shall be as required by 
this section and Table 1704.4. 

Exception: Special inspections shall not be required for:

simulate the applicable loading conditions specified in Chapter 
16 as necessary to address the concerns regarding structural 
stability of the building, structure or portion thereof. 

1713.3.1 Load test procedure specified. Where a standard 
listed in Chapter 35 contains an applicable load test proce- 
dure and acceptance criteria, the test procedure and accep- 
tance criteria in the standard shall apply. In the absence of 
specific load factors or acceptance criteria, the load factors 
and acceptance criteria in Section 1713.3.2 shall apply. 

1713.3.2 Load test procedure not specified. In the absence

assembly shall be considered to have successfully met the 
test requirements if the assembly recovers not less than 75 
percent of the maximum deflection within 24 hours after the 
removal of the test load. The test assembly shall then be 
reloaded and subjected to an increasing superimposed load 
until either structural failure occurs or the superimposed 
load is equal to two and one-half times the load at which the 
deflection limitations specified in Section 1714.3.2 were 
reached, or the load is equal to two and one-half times the 
superimposed design load. In the case of structural compo- 
nents and assemblies for which deflection limitations are 
not specified in Section 1714.3.2, the test specimen shall be 
subjected to an increasing superimposed load until struc- 
tural failure occurs or the load is equal to two and one-half 
times the desired superimposed design load. The allowable 
superimposed design load shall be taken as the lesser of: 

1. The load at the deflection limitation given in Section 
1714.3.2. 

2. The failure load divided by 2.5. 

3. The maximum load applied divided by 2.5.

degrees (0.52 rad) with the horizontal, unless the material 
supporting the higher footing is braced or retained or other- 
wise laterally supported in an approved manner or a greater 
slope has been properly established by engineering analy- 
sis. 

1805.2.3 Shifting or moving soils. Where it is known that 
the shallow subsoils are of a shifting or moving character, 



footings shall be carried to a sufficient depth to ensure stabil-

eral support for the footing without detrimental settlement. 
Except as provided for in Section 1805.3.5 and Figure 
1805.3.1, the following setback is deemed adequate to 
meet the criteria. Where the slope is steeper than 1 unit ver- 
tical in 1 unit horizoiital (100-percent slope), the required 
setback shall be measured from an imaginary plane 45 
degrees (0.79 rad) to the horizontal, projected upward 
from the toe of the slope. 

1805.3.3 Pools. The setback between pools regulated by 
this code and slopes shall be equal to one-half the building 
footing setback distance required by this section. That por-

ject to the approval of the building official, provided it can 
be demonstrated that required drainage to the point of dis- 
charge and away from the structure is provided at all loca- 
tions on the site. 

1805.3.5 Alternate setback and clearance. Alternate set- 
backs and clearances are permitted, subject to the approval of 
the building official. The building official is permitted to 
require an investigation and recommendation of a registered

placed under or in the presence of water, the concrete 
shall be deposited by approved means to ensure mini- 
mum segregation of the mix and negligible turbulence of 
the water. 

1805.4.2.5 Protection of concrete. Concrete footings 
shall be protected from freezing during depositing and for 
a period of not less than five days thereafter. Water shall 
not be allowed to flow through the deposited concrete. 

1805.4.2.6 Forming of concrete. Concrete footings are 
permitted to be cast against the earth where, in the opin- 
ion of the building official, soil conditions do not require 
forming. Where forming is required, it shall be in accor- 
dance with Chapter 6 of ACI 318. 

1805.4.3 Masonry-unit footings. The design, materials 
and construction of masonry-unit footings shall comply 
with Sections 1805.4.3.1 and 1805.4.3.2, and the provisions 
of Chapter 21. 

Exception: Where a specific design is not provided, 
masonry-unit footings supporting walls of light-frame 
construction are permitted to be designed in accordance 
with Table 1805.4.2. 

1805.4.3.1 Dimensions. Masonry-unit footings shall be 
laid in Type M or S mortar complying with Section 
2103.8 and the depth shall not be less than twice the pro- 
jection beyond the wall, pier or column. The width shall 
not be less than 8 inches (203 mm) wider than the wall 
supported thereon. 



1805.4.3.2 Offsets. The maximum offset of each course 
in brick foundation walls stepped up from the footings 
shall be 1.5 inches (38 mm) where laid in single courses, 
and 3 inches (76 mm) where laid in double courses. 

1805.4.4 Steel grillage footings. Grillage footings of struc- 
tural steel shapes shall be separated with approved steel 
spacers and be entirely encased in concrete with at least 6 
inches (152 mm) on the bottom and at least 4 inches (102 
mm) at all other points. The spaces between the shapes shall 
be completely filled with concrete or cement grout. 

1805.4.5 Timber footings. Timber footings are permitted 
for buildings of Type V construction and as otherwise 
approved by the building official. Such footings shall be 
treated in accordance with AWPA Ul (Commodity Specifi- I 
cation A, Use Category 4B). Treated timbers are not I 
required where placed entirely below permanent water level 
or where used as capping for wood piles that project above 
the water level over submerged or marsh lands. The com- 
pressive stresses perpendicular to the grain in untreated tim- 
ber footings supported upon treated piles shall not exceed I 
70 percent of the allowable stresses for the species and grade 
of timber as specified in the AF&amp;PA NDS. 

. 1805.4.6 Wood foundations. Wood foundation systems 
shall be designed and installed in accordance with AF&amp;PA 
Technical Report No. 7. Lumber and plywood shall be 
treated in accordance with AWPA Ul (Commodity Specifi- I 
cation A, Use Category 4B and Section 5.2) and shall be I 
identified in accordance with Section 2303.1.8.1. 

1805.5 Foundation walls. Concrete and masonry foundation 
walls shall be designed in accordance with Chapter 19 or 21, 
respectively. Foundation walls that are laterally supported at I 
the top and bottom and within the parameters of Tables I 
1805.5(1) through 1805.5(5) are permitted to be designed and | 
constructed in accordance with Sections 1805.5.1 through 
1805.5.5. 

1805.5.1 Foundation wall thickness. The minimum thick- 
ness of concrete and masonry foundation walls shall comply 
with Sections 1805.5.1.1 through 1805.5.1.3. 

1805.5.1.1 Thickness at top of foundation wall. The | 

thickness of foundation walls shall not be less than the 
thickness of the wall supported, except that foundation 
walls of at least 8-inch (203 mm) nominal width are per- 
mitted to support brick-veneered frame walls and 
10-inch- wide (254 mm) cavity walls provided the 
requirements of Section 1805.5.1.2 are met. Corbeling 
of masonry shall be in accordance with Section 2104.2. 
Where an 8-inch (203 mm) wall is corbeled, the top cor- 
bel shall not extend higher than the bottom of the floor 
framing and shall be a full course of headers at least 6 
inches (152 mm) in length or the top course bed joint 
shall be tied to the vertical wall projection. The tie shall 
be W2.8 (4.8 mm) and spaced at a maximum horizontal 
distance of 36 inches (914 mm); the hollow space behind 
the corbelled masonry shall be filled with mortar or 
grout.

SECTION 1808 
PIER AND PILE FOUNDATIONS 

1808.1 Definitions. The following words and terms shall, for 
the purposes of this section, have the meanings shown herein. 

FLEXURAL LENGTH. Flexural length is the length of the 
pile from the first point of zero lateral deflection to the under- 
side of the pile cap or grade beam. 

MICROPILES. Micropiles are 12-inch-diameter (305 mm) 
or less bored, grouted-in-place piles incorporating steel pipe 
(casing) and/or steel reinforcement. 

PIER FOUNDATIONS. Pier foundations consist of isolated 
masonry or cast-in-place concrete structural elements extend- 
ing into firm materials. Piers are relatively short in comparison 
to their width, with lengths less than or equal to 12 times the 
least horizontal dimension of the pier. Piers derive their 
load-carrying capacity through skin friction, through end bear- 
ing, or a combination of both. 

Belled piers. Belled piers are cast-in-place concrete piers 
constructed with a base that is larger than the diameter of the 
remainder of the pier. The belled base is designed to 
increase the load-bearing area of the pier in end bearing. 

PILE FOUNDATIONS. Pile foundations consist of concrete, 
wood or steel structural elements either driven into the ground 
or cast in place. Piles are relatively slender in comparison to 
their length, with lengths exceeding 12 times the least horizon- 
tal dimension. Piles derive their load-carrying capacity through 
skin friction, end bearing or a combination of both. 

Angered uncased piles. Angered uncased piles are con- 
structed by depositing concrete into an uncased augered 
hole, either during or after the withdrawal of the auger.

SOILS AND FOUNDATIONS 



Caisson piles. Caisson piles are cast-in-place concrete piles 
extending into bedrock. The upper portion of a caisson pile 
consists of a cased pile that extends to the bedrock. The 
lower portion of the caisson pile consists of an uncased 
socket drilled into the bedrock. 

Concrete-filled steel pipe and tube piles. Concrete-filled 
steel pipe and tube piles are constructed by driving a steel 
pipe or tube section into the soil and filling the pipe or tube 
section with concrete. The steel pipe or tube section is left in 
place during and after the deposition of the concrete. 

Driven uncased piles. Driven uncased piles are constructed 
by driving a steel shell into the soil to shore an unexcavated 
hole that is later filled with concrete. The steel casing is 
lifted out of the hole during the deposition of the concrete. 

Enlarged base piles. Enlarged base piles are cast-in-place 
concrete piles constructed with a base that is larger than the 
diameter of the remainder of the pile. The enlarged base is 
designed to increase the load-bearing area of the pile in end 
bearing. 

Steel-cased piles. Steel-cased piles are constructed by driv- 
ing a steel shell into the soil to shore an unexcavated hole. 
The steel casing is left permanently in place and filled with 
concrete. 

I Timber piles. Timber piles are round, tapered timbers with 
the small (tip) end embedded into the soil. 

1808.2 Piers and piles â general requirements. 

1808.2.1 Design. Piles are permitted to be designed in 
accordance with provisions for piers in Section 1808 and 
Sections 1812.3 through 1812.10 where either of the fol- 
lowing conditions exists, subject to the approval of the 
building official: 

1 . Group R-3 and U occupancies not exceeding two sto- 
ries of light-frame construction, or 

2. Where the surrounding foundation materials furnish 
adequate lateral support for the pile. 

1808.2.2 General. Pier and pile foundations shall be 
designed and installed on the basis of a foundation investi- 
gation as defined in Section 1802, unless sufficient data 
upon which to base the design and installation is available. 

The investigation and report provisions of Section 1802 
shall be expanded to include, but not be limited to, the fol- 
lowing: 

1 . Recommended pier or pile types and installed capaci- 
ties. 

2. Recommended center-to-center spacing of piers or 
piles. 

3. Driving criteria. 

4. Installation procedures. 

5. Field inspection and reporting procedures (to include 
procedures for verification of the installed bearing 
capacity where required). 

6. Pier or pile load test requirements, 

7. Durability of pier or pile materials. 



8. Designation of bearing stratum or strata, 

9. Reductions for group action, where necessary. 

1808.2.3 Special types of piles. The use of types of piles not 
specifically mentioned herein is permitted, subject to the 
approval of the building official, upon the submission of 
acceptable test data, calculations and other information 
relating to the structural properties and load capacity of such 
piles. The allowable stresses shall not in any case exceed the 
limitations specified herein. 

1808.2.4 Pile caps. Pile caps shall be of reinforced concrete, 
and shall include all elements to which piles are connected, 
including grade beams and mats. The soil immediately 
below the pile cap shall not be considered as carrying any 
vertical load. The tops of piles shall be embedded not less 
than 3 inches (76 mm) into pile caps and the caps shall 
extend at least 4 inches (102 mm) beyond the edges of piles. 
The tops of piles shall be cut back to sound material before 
capping. 

1808.2.5 Stability. Piers or piles shall be braced to provide 
lateral stability in all directions. Three or more piles con- 
nected by a rigid cap shall be considered braced, provided 
that the piles are located in radial directions from the cen- 
troid of the group not less than 60 degrees (1 rad) apart. A 
two-pile group in a rigid cap shall be considered to be 
braced along the axis connecting the two piles. Methods 
used to brace piers or piles shall be subject to the approval of 
the building official. 

Piles supporting walls shall be driven alternately in lines 
spaced at least 1 foot (305 mm) apart and located symmet- 
rically under the center of gravity of the wall load carried, 
unless effective measures are taken to provide for eccen- 
tricity and lateral forces, or the wall piles are adequately 
braced to provide for lateral stability. A single row of piles 
without lateral bracing is permitted for one- and two-fam- 
ily dwellings and lightweight construction not exceeding 
two stories or 35 feet (10 668 mm) in height, provided the 
centers of the piles are located within the width of the foun- 
dation wall. 

1808.2.6 Structural integrity. Piers or piles shall be 
installed in such a manner and sequence as to prevent distor- 
tion or damage that may adversely affect the structural I 
integrity of piles being installed or already in place. | 

1808.2.7 Splices. Splices shall be constructed so as to pro- 
vide and maintain true alignment and position of the compo- 
nent parts of the pier or pile during installation and 
subsequent thereto and shall be of adequate strength to 
transmit the vertical and lateral loads and moments occur- 
ring at the location of the splice during driving and under 
service loading. Splices shall develop not less than 50 per- 
cent of the least capacity of the pier or pile in bending. In 
addition, splices occurring in the upper 10 feet (3048 mm) 
of the embedded portion of the pier or pile shall be capable 
of resisting at allowable working stresses the moment and 
shear that would result from an assumed eccentricity of the 
pier or pile load of 3 inches (76 mm), or the pier or pile shall 
be braced in accordance with Section 1 808 .2.5 to other piers 
or piles that do not have splices in the upper 10 feet (3048 
mm) of embedment.

SOILS AND FOUNDATIONS 



1808.2.8 Allowable pier or pile loads. 

1808.2.8.1 Determination of allowable loads. The 

allowable axial and lateral loads on piers or piles shall be 
determined by an approved formula, load tests or method 
of analysis. 

1808.2.8.2 Driving criteria. The allowable compressive 
load on any pile where determined by the application of 
an approved driving formula shall not exceed 40 tons 
(356 kN). For allowable loads above 40 tons (356 kN), 
the wave equation method of analysis shall be used to 
estimate pile driveability of both driving stresses and net 
displacement per blow at the ultimate load. Allowable 
loads shall be verified by load tests in accordance with 
Section 1808.2.8.3. The formula or wave equation load 
shall be determined for gravity-drop or power-actuated 
hammers and the hammer energy used shall be the maxi- 
mum consistent with the size, strength and weight of the 
driven piles. The use of a follower is permitted only with 
the approval of the building official. The introduction of 
fresh hammer cushion or pile cushion material just prior 
to final penetration is not permitted. 

1808.2.8.3 Load tests. Where design compressive loads 
per pier or pile are greater than those permitted by Sec- 
tion 1808.2.10 or where the design load for any pier or 
pile foundation is in doubt, control test piers or piles shall 
be tested in accordance with ASTM D 1 143 or ASTM D 
4945. At least one pier or pile shall be test loaded in each 
area of uniform subsoil conditions. Where required by 
the building official, additional piers or piles shall be 
load tested where necessary to establish the safe design 
capacity. The resulting allowable loads shall not be more 
than one-half of the ultimate axial load capacity of the 
test pier or pile as assessed by one of the pubUshed meth- 
ods Hsted in Section 1808.2.8.3.1 with consideration for 
the test type, duration and subsoil. The ultimate axial 
load capacity shall be determined by a registered design 
professional with consideration given to tolerable total 
and differential settlements at design load in accordance 
with Section 1808.2.12. In subsequent installation of the 
balance of foundation piles, all piles shall be deemed to 
have a supporting capacity equal to the control pile 
where such piles are of the same type, size and relative 
length as the test pile; are installed using the same or 
comparable methods and equipment as the test pile; are 
installed in similar subsoil conditions as the test pile; 
and, for driven piles, where the rate of penetration (e.g., 
net displacement per blow) of such piles is equal to or 
less than that of the test pile driven with the same hammer 
through a comparable driving distance. 

1808.2.8.3.1 Load test evaluation. It shall be permit- 
ted to evaluate pile load tests with any of the following 
methods: 

1. Davisson Offset Limit. 

2. Brinch-Hansen 90% Criterion. 

3. Butler-Hoy Criterion. 

4. Other methods approved by the building offi- 
cial. 



1808.2.8.4 Allowable frictional resistance. The 

assumed frictional resistance developed by any pier or 
uncased cast-in-place pile shall not exceed one-sixth of 
the bearing value of the soil material at minimum depth 
as set forth in Table 1804.2, up to a maximum of 500 psf 
(24 kPa), unless a greater value is allowed by the building 
official after a soil investigation, as specified in Section 
1 802, is submitted or a greater value is substantiated by a | 
load test in accordance with Section 1808.2.8.3. Fric- I 
tional resistance and bearing resistance shall not be 
assumed to act simultaneously unless recommended by a 
soil investigation as specified in Section 1802. 

1808.2.8.5 Uplift capacity. Where required by the 
design, the uplift capacity of a single pier or pile shall be 
determined by an approved method of analysis based on 
a minimum factor of safety of three or by load tests con- 
ducted in accordance with ASTM D 3689. The maxi- 
mum allowable uplift load shall not exceed the ultimate 
load capacity as determined in Section 1808.2.8.3 
divided by a factor of safety of two. For pile groups sub- 
jected to uplift, the allowable working uplift load for the 
group shall be the lesser of: 

1. The proposed individual pile uplift working load 
times the number of piles in the group. 

2. Two-thirds of the effective weight of the pile 
group and the soil contained within a block defined 
by the perimeter of the group and the length of the 
pile. 

1808.2.8.6 Load-bearing capacity. Piers, individual 
piles and groups of piles shall develop ultimate load 
capacities of at least twice the design working loads in 
the designated load-bearing layers. Analysis shall show 
that no soil layer underlying the designated load-bearing 
layers causes the load-bearing capacity safety factor to 
be less than two. 

1808.2.8.7 Bent piers or piles. The load-bearing capac- 
ity of piers or piles discovered to have a sharp or sweep- 
ing bend shall be determined by an approved method of 
analysis or by load testing a representative pier or pile. 

1808.2.8.8 Overloads on piers or piles. The maximum 
compressive load on any pier or pile due to mislocation 
shall not exceed 110 percent of the allowable design 
load. 

1808.2.9 Lateral support. 

1808.2.9.1 General. Any soil other than fluid soil shall 
be deemed to afford sufficient lateral support to the pier 
or pile to prevent buckling and to permit the design of the 
pier or pile in accordance with accepted engineering 
practice and the applicable provisions of this code. 

1808.2.9.2 Unbraced piles. Piles standing unbraced in 
air, water or in fluid soils shall be designed as columns in 
accordance with the provisions of this code. Such piles 
driven into firm ground can be considered fixed and lat- 
erally supported at 5 feet (1524 mm) below the ground 
surface and in soft material at 10 feet (3048 mm) below 
the ground surface unless otherwise prescribed by the

SOILS AND FOUNDATIONS 



building official after a foundation investigation by an 
approved agency. 

1808.2.9.3 Allowable lateral load. Where required by 
the design, the lateral load capacity of a pier, a single pile 
or a pile group shall be determined by an approved 
method of analysis or by lateral load tests to at least twice 
the proposed design working load. The resulting allow- 
able load shall not be more than one-half of that test load 
that produces a gross lateral movement of 1 inch (25 mm) 
at the ground surface. 

1808.2.10 Use of higher allowable pier or pile stresses. 

Allowable stresses greater than those specified for piers or 
for each pile type in Sections 1809 and 1810 are permitted 
where supporting data justifying such higher stresses is filed 
with the building official. Such substantiating data shall 
include: 

1. A soils investigation in accordance with Section 
1802. 

2. Pier or pile load tests in accordance with Section 
1808.2.8.3, regardless of the load supported by the 
pier or pile. 

The design and installation of the pier or pile foundation 
shall be under the direct supervision of a registered design 
professional knowledgeable in the field of soil mechanics 
and pier or pile foundations who shall certify to the building 
official that the piers or piles as installed satisfy the design 
criteria. 

1808.2.11 Piles in subsiding areas. Where piles are 
installed through subsiding fills or other subsiding strata 
and derive support from underlying firmer materials, con- 
sideration shall be given to the downward frictional forces 
that may be imposed on the piles by the subsiding upper 
strata. 

Where the influence of subsiding fills is considered as 
imposing loads on the pile, the allowable stresses specified 
in this chapter are permitted to be increased where satisfac- 
tory substantiating data are submitted. 

1808.2.12 Settlement analysis. The settlement of piers, 
individual piles or groups of piles shall be estimated based 
on approved methods of analysis. The predicted settlement 
shall cause neither harmful distortion of, nor instability in, 
the structure, nor cause any stresses to exceed allowable val- 
ues. 

1808.2.13 Preexcavation. The use of jetting, angering or 
other methods of preexcavation shall be subject to the 
approval of the building official. Where permitted, 
preexcavation shall be carried out in the same manner as 
used for piers or piles subject to load tests and in such a man- 
ner that will not impair the carrying capacity of the piers or 
piles already in place or damage adjacent structures. Pile 
tips shall be driven below the preexcavated depth until the 
required resistance or penetration is obtained. 

1808.2.14 Installation sequence. Piles shall be installed in 
such sequence as to avoid compacting the surrounding soil 



to the extent that other piles cannot be installed properly, 
and to prevent ground movements that are capable of dam- 
aging adjacent structures. 

1808.2.15 Use of vibratory drivers. Vibratory drivers shall 
only be used to install piles where the pile load capacity is 
verified by load tests in accordance with Section 1 808.2.8.3. 
The installation of production piles shall be controlled 
according to power consumption, rate of penetration or 
other approved means that ensure pile capacities equal or 
exceed those of the test piles. 

1808.2.16 Pile driveability. Pile cross sections shall be of 
sufficient size and strength to withstand driving stresses 
without damage to the pile, and to provide sufficient stiff- 
ness to transmit the required driving forces. 

1808.2.17 Protection of pile materials. Where boring 
records or site conditions indicate possible deleterious 
action on pier or pile materials because of soil constituents, 
changing water levels or other factors, the pier or pile mate- 
rials shall be adequately protected by materials, methods or 
processes approved by the building official. Protective 
materials shall be applied to the piles so as not to be rendered 
ineffective by driving. The effectiveness of such protective 
measures for the particular purpose shall have been thor- 
oughly established by satisfactory service records or other 
evidence. 

1808.2.18 Use of existing piers or piles. Piers or piles left 
in place where a structure has been demolished shall not be 
used for the support of new construction unless satisfactory 
evidence is submitted to the building official, which indi- 
cates that the piers or piles are sound and meet the require- 
ments of this code. Such piers or piles shall be load tested or 
redriven to verify their capacities. The design load applied 
to such piers or piles shall be the lowest allowable load as 
determined by tests or redriving data. 

1808.2.19 Heaved piles. Piles that have heaved during the 
driving of adjacent piles shall be redriven as necessary to 
develop the required capacity and penetration, or the capac- 
ity of the pile shall be verified by load tests in accordance 
with Section 1808.2.8.3. . 

1808.2.20 Identification. Pier or pile materials shall be 
identified for conformity to the specified grade with this 
identity maintained continuously from the point of manu- 
facture to the point of installation or shall be tested by an 
approved agency to determine conformity to the specified 
grade. The approved agency shall furnish an affidavit of 
compliance to the building official. 

1808.2.21 Pier or pile location plan. A plan showing the 
location and designation of piers or piles by an identifica- 
tion system shall be filed with the building official prior to 
installation of such piers or piles. Detailed records for piers 
or individual piles shall bear an identification correspond- 
ing to that shown on the plan. 

1808.2.22 Special inspection. Special inspections in accor- 
dance with Sections 1704.8 and 1704.9 shall be provided 
for piles and piers, respectively.

1808.2.23 Seismic design of piers or piles. 

1808.2.23.1 Seismic Design Category C. Where a 
structure is assigned to Seismic Design Category C in 
accordance with Section 1613, the following shall apply. 
Individual pile caps, piers or piles shall be intercon- 
nected by ties. Ties shall be capable of carrying, in ten- 
sion and compression, a force equal to the product of the 
larger pile cap or column load times the seismic coeffi- 
cient, Sps, divided by 10 unless it can be demonstrated 
that equivalent restraint is provided by reinforced con- 
crete beams within slabs on grade, reinforced concrete 
slabs on grade, confinement by competent rock, hard 
cohesive soils or very dense granular soils. 

Exception: Piers supporting foundation walls, iso- 
lated interior posts detailed so the pier is not subject to 
lateral loads, lightly loaded exterior decks and patios 
of Group R-3 and U occupancies not exceeding two 
stories of light-frame construction, are not subject to 
interconnection if it can be shown the soils are of ade- 
quate stiffness, subject to the approval of the building 
official. 

1808.2.23.1.1 Connection to pile cap. Concrete piles 
and concrete-filled steel pipe piles shall be connected 
to the pile cap by embedding the pile reinforcement or 
field-placed dowels anchored in the concrete pile in 
the pile cap for a distance equal to the development 
length. For deformed bars, the development length is 
the full development length for compression or ten- 
sion, in the case of uplift, without reduction in length 
for excess area. Alternative measures for laterally 
confining concrete and maintaining toughness and 
ductile-like behavior at the top of the pile will be per- 
mitted provided the design is such that any hinging 
occurs in the confined region. 

Ends of hoops, spirals and ties shall be terminated 
with seismic hooks, as defined in Section 21 . 1 of ACI 
318, turned into the confined concrete core. The mini- 
mum transverse steel ratio for confinement shall not 
be less than one-half of that required for columns. 

For resistance to uplift forces, anchorage of steel 
pipe (round HSS sections), concrete-filled steel pipe 
or H-piles to the pile cap shall be made by means other 
than concrete bond to the bare steel section. 

Exception: Anchorage of concrete-filled steel 
pipe piles is permitted to be accomplished using 
deformed bars developed into the concrete portion 
of the pile. 

Splices of pile segments shall develop the full 
strength of the pile, but the splice need not develop the 
nominal strength of the pile in tension, shear and 
bending when it has been designed to resist axial and 
shear forces and moments from the load combina- 
tions of Section 1605.4. 

1808.2.23.1.2 Design details. Pier or pile moments, 
shears and lateral deflections used for design shall be 
established considering the nonlinear interaction of 
the shaft and soil, as recommended by a registered 



design professional. Where the ratio of the depth of 
embedment of the pile-to-pile diameter or width is 
less than or equal to six, the pile may be assumed to be 
rigid. 

Pile group effects from soil on lateral pile nominal 
strength shall be included where pile center-to-center 
spacing in the direction of lateral force is less than 
eight pile diameters. Pile group effects on vertical 
nominal strength shall be included where pile cen- 
ter-to-center spacing is less than three pile diameters. 
The pile uplift soil nominal strength shall be taken as 
the pile uplift strength as limited by the frictional 
force developed between the soil and the pile. 

Where a minimum length for reinforcement or the 
extent of closely spaced confinement reinforcement is 
specified at the top of the pier or pile, provisions shall 
be made so that those specified lengths or extents are 
maintained after pier or pile cutoff. 

1808.2.23.2 Seismic Design Category D, E or E Where 
a structure is assigned to Seismic Design Category D, E 
or F in accordance with Section 1613, the requirements 
for Seismic Design Category C given in Section 
1808.2.23.1 shall be met, in addition to the following. 
Provisions of ACI 318, Section 21.10.4, shall apply 
when not in conflict with the provisions of Sections 1 808 
through 1812. Concrete shall have a specified compres- 
sive strength of not less than 3,000 psi (20.68 MPa) at 28 
days. 

Exceptions: 

1 . Group R or U occupancies of light-framed con- 
struction and two stories or less in height are 
permitted to use concrete with a specified com- 
pressive strength of not less than 2,500 psi (17.2 
MPa) at 28 days. 

2. Detached one- and two-family dwellings of 
light-frame construction and two stories or less 
in height are not required to comply with the 
provisions of ACI 318, Section 21.10.4. 

3. Section 21 .10.4.4( a) of ACI 318 need not apply 
to concrete piles. 

1808.2.23.2.1 Design details for piers, piles and 
grade beams. Piers or piles shall be designed and 
constructed to withstand maximum imposed curva- 
tures from earthquake ground motions and structure

2304.8 Lumber decking. 

2304.8.1 General. Lumber decking shall be designed and 
installed in accordance with the general provisions of this 
code and the provisions of this section. Each piece shall be 
square-end trimmed. When random lengths are furnished, 
each piece shall be square-end trimmed across the face so 
that at least 90 percent of the pieces will be within 0.5 
degrees (0.00873 rad) of square. The ends of the pieces shall 
be permitted to be beveled up to 2 degrees (0.0349 rad) from 
vertical with the exposed face of the piece slightly longer 
than the back of the piece. Tongue-and-groove decking shall 
be installed with the tongues up on sloped or pitched roofs 
with pattern faces down. 

2304.8.2 Layup patterns. Lumber decking is permitted to 
be laid up following one of five standard patterns as defined 
in Sections 2304.8.2.1 through 2304.8.2.5. Other patterns 
are permitted to be used if justified by engineering analysis. 

2304.8.2.1 Simple span pattern. All pieces shall be sup- 
ported by two supports. 

2304.8.2.2 Two-span continuous pattern. All pieces 
shall be supported by three supports, and all end joints 
shall occur in line on every other support. Supporting 
members shall be designed to accommodate the load 
redistribution caused by this pattern. 

2304.8.2.3 Combination simple and two-span contin- 
uous pattern. Courses in end spans shall be alternating 
simple span and two span continuous. End joints are 
staggered in adjacent courses and occur only over sup- 
ports. 

2304.8.2.4 Cantilevered pieces intermixed pattern. 

The decking shall cover a minimum of three spans. 



Pieces in the starter course and every third course shall be 
simple span. Pieces in other courses shall be cantilevered 
over the supports with end joints at alternate quarter or 
third points of the spans, and each piece shall bear on at 
least one support. 

2304.8.2.5 Controlled random pattern. The decking 
shall cover a minimum of three spans. End joints within 6 
inches (152 mm) of being in line in either direction shall 
be separated by at least two intervening courses. In the 
end bays each piece shall bear on at least one support. 
Where an end joint occurs in an end bay, the next piece in 
the same course shall continue over the first inner sup- 
port for at least 24 inches (610 mm). The details of the 
controlled random pattern shall be as described for each 
decking material in Section 2304.8.3.3, 2304.8.4.3 or 
2304.8.5.3. 

For cantilevered spans with the controlled random pat- 
tern, special considerations shall be made when the over- 
hang exceeds 18 inches (457 mm), 24 inches (610 mm) 
or 36 inches (914 mm) for 2-inch (51 mm), 3-inch (76 
mm) or 4-inch (102 mm) nominal thickness decking, 
respectively. The maximum cantilevered length for the 
controlled random pattern shall be 30 percent of the 
length of the first adjacent interior span. For cantilever 
overhangs within these limits, a structural fascia shall be 
fastened to each decking piece to maintain a continuous, 
straight roof line. There shall be no end joints in the can- 
tilevered portion or within one-half of the first adjacent 
interior span. 

2304.8.3 Mechanically laminated decking. 

2304.8.3.1 General. Mechanically laminated decking 
consists of square-edged dimension lumber laminations

SECTION 2305 

GENERAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS FOR 

LATERAL-FORCE-RESISTING SYSTEMS 

2305.1 General. Structures using wood shear walls and dia- 
phragms to resist wind, seismic and other lateral loads shall be 
designed and constructed in accordance with the provisions of 
this section. Alternatively, compliance with the AF&amp;PA 
SDPWS shall be permitted subject to the limitations therein and 
the limitations of this code. 

2305.1.1 Shear resistance based on principles of mechan- 
ics. Shear resistance of diaphragms and shear walls are per- 
mitted to be calculated by principles of mechanics using 
values of fastener strength and sheathing shear resistance. 

2305.1.2 Framing. Boundary elements shall be provided to 
transmit tension and compression forces. Perimeter mem- 
bers at openings shall be provided and shall be detailed to 
distribute the shearing stresses. Diaphragm and shear wall 
sheathing shall not be used to splice boundary elements. 
Diaphragm chords and collectors shall be placed in, or tan- 
gent to, the plane of the diaphragm framing unless it can be 
demonstrated that the moments, shears and deformations, 
considering eccentricities resulting from other configura- 
tions can be tolerated without exceeding the adjusted resis- 
tance and drift limits. 



2305.1.2.1 Framing members. Framing members shall 
be at least 2 inch (51 mm) nominal width. In general, 
adjoining panel edges shall bear and be attached to the 
framing members and butt along their centerlines. Nails 
shall be placed not less than % inch (9.5 mm) from the 
panel edge, not more than 12 inches (305 mm) apart 
along intermediate supports, and 6 inches (152 mm) 
along panel edge bearings, and shall be firmly driven into 
the framing members. 

2305.1.3 Openings in shear panels. Openings in shear 
panels that materially affect their strength shall be fully 
detailed on the plans, and shall have their edges adequately 
reinforced to transfer all shearing stresses. 

2305.1.4 Shear panel connections. Positive connections 
and anchorages capable of resisting the design forces shall 
be provided between the shear panel and the attached com- 
ponents. In Seismic Design Category D, E or F, the capacity 
of toenail connections shall not be used when calculating 
lateral load resistance to transfer lateral earthquake forces in 
excess of 150 pounds per foot (2189 N/m) from diaphragms 
to shear walls, drag struts (collectors) or other elements, or 
from shear walls to other elements. 

2305.1.5 Wood members resisting horizontal seismic 
forces contributed by masonry and concrete walls. Wood 
shear walls, diaphragms, horizontal trusses and other mem- 
bers shall not be used to resist horizontal seismic forces con- 
tributed by masonry or concrete walls in structures over one 
story in height. 

Exceptions: 

1 . Wood floor and roof members are permitted to be 
used in horizontal trusses and diaphragms to resist 
horizontal seismic forces contributed by masonry 
or concrete walls, provided such forces do not 
result in torsional force distribution through the 
truss or diaphragm. 

2. Wood structural panel sheathed shear walls are 
permitted to be used to provide resistance to seis- 
mic forces contributed by masonry or concrete 
walls in two-story structures of masonry or con- 
crete walls, provided the following requirements 
are met: 

2.1. Story-to-story wall heights shall not 
exceed 12 feet (3658 mm). 

2.2. Diaphragms shall not be designed to trans- 
mit lateral forces by rotation and shall not 
cantilever past the outermost supporting 
shear wall. 

2.3. Combined deflections of diaphragms and 
shear walls shall not permit story drift of 
supported masonry or concrete walls to 
exceed the limit of Section 12.12.1 in 
ASCE 7. 

2.4. Wood structural panel sheathing in dia- 
phragms shall have unsupported edges 
blocked. Wood structural panel sheathing 
for both stories of shear walls shall have 



2006 INTERNATIONAL BUILDING CODE'' 



435 



WOOD 



unsupported edges blocked and, for the 
lower story, shall have a minimum thick- 
ness of ^V32 inch (11. 9 mm). 

2.5. There shall be no out-of-plane horizontal 
offsets between the first and second stories 
of wood structural panel shear walls. 

2305.1.6 Wood members resisting seismic forces from 
nonstructural concrete or masonry. Wood members shall 
be permitted to resist horizontal seismic forces from 
nonstructural concrete, masonry veneer or concrete floors. 

2305.2 Design of wood diaphragms. 

2305.2.1 General. Wood diaphragms are permitted to be 
used to resist horizontal forces provided the deflection in 
the plane of the diaphragm, as determined by calculations, 
tests or analogies drawn therefrom, does not exceed the 
permissible deflection of attached distributing or resisting 
elements. Connections shall extend into the diaphragm a 
sufficient distance to develop the force transferred into the 
diaphragm. 

2305.2.2 Deflection. Permissible deflection shall be that 
deflection up to which the diaphragm and any attached dis- 
tributing or resisting element will maintain its structural 
integrity under design load conditions, such that the resist- 
ing element will continue to support design loads without 
danger to occupants of the structure. Calculations for dia- 
phragm deflection shall account for the usual bending and 
shear components as well as any other factors, such as nail 
deformation, which will contribute to deflection. 

The deflection (A) of a blocked wood structural panel 
diaphragm uniformly nailed throughout is permitted to be 
calculated by using the following equation. If not uniformly 
nailed, the constant 0.188 (For SI: Vjgj?) in the third term 
must be modified accordingly.

2305.2.4.1 Seismic Design Category F. Structures 
assigned to Seismic Design Category F shall conform to 
the additional requirements of this section. 

Wood structural panel sheathing used for diaphragms 
and shear walls that are part of the seismic-force-resist- 
ing system shall be applied directly to the framing mem- 
bers. 

Exception: Wood structural panel sheathing in a dia- 
phragm is permitted to be fastened over soUd lumber 
planking or laminated decking, provided the panel 
joints and lumber planking or laminated decking 
joints do not coincide. 

2305.2.5 Rigid diaphragms. Design of structures with 
rigid diaphragms shall conform to the structure configura- 
tion requirements of Section 12.3.2 of ASCE 7 and the hori- 
zontal shear distribution requirements of Section 12.8.4 of 
ASCE 7. 

Open-front structures with rigid wood diaphragms result- 
ing in torsional force distribution are permitted, provided 
the length, /, of the diaphragm normal to the open side does 
not exceed 25 feet (7620 mm), the diaphragm sheathing 
conforms to Section 2305.2.4 and the l/w ratio [as shown in 
Figure 2305.2.5(1)] is less than 1 for one-story structures or 
0.67 for structures over one story in height. 

Exception: Where calculations show that diaphragm 
deflections can be tolerated, the length, /, normal to the 
open end is permitted to be increased to a l/w ratio not 
greater than 1.5 where sheathed in compliance with Sec- 
tion 2305.2.4 or to 1 where sheathed in compliance with 
Section 2306.3.4 or 2306.3.5. 

Rigid wood diaphragms are permitted to cantilever past 
the outermost supporting shearwall (or other vertical resist- 
ing element) a length, /, of not more than 25 feet (7620 mm) 
or two-thirds of the diaphragm width, w, whichever is 
smaller. Figure 2305.2.5(2) illustrates the dimensions of / 
and w for a cantilevered diaphragm. 

Structures with rigid wood diaphragms having a torsional 
irregularity in accordance with Table 12.3-1, Item 1, of 
ASCE 7 shall meet the following requirements: the l/w ratio 



shall not exceed 1 for one-story structures or 0.67 for 
structures over one story in height, where / is the dimension 
parallel to the load direction for which the irregularity 
exists. 

Exception: Where calculations demonstrate that the dia- 
phragm deflections can be tolerated, the width is permit- 
ted to be increased and the l/w ratio is permitted to be 
increased to 1.5 where sheathed in compliance with Sec- 
tion 2305.2.4 or 1 where sheathed in compliance with 
Section 2306.3.4 or 2306.3.5. 

2305.3 Design of wood shear walls. 

2305.3.1 General. Wood shear walls are permitted to resist 
horizontal forces in vertical distributing or resisting ele- 
ments, provided the deflection in the plane of the shear wall, 
as determined by calculations, tests or analogies drawn 
therefrom, does not exceed the more restrictive of the per- 
missible deflection of attached distributing or resisting ele- 
ments or the drift limits of Section 1 2. 1 2. 1 of ASCE 7 . Shear 
wall sheathing other than wood structural panels shall not be 
permitted in Seismic Design Category E or F (see Section 
1613). 

2305.3.2 Deflection. Permissible deflection shall be that 
deflection up to which the shear wall and any attached dis- 
tributing or resisting element will maintain its structural 
integrity under design load conditions, i.e., continue to sup- 
port design loads without danger to occupants of the struc- 
ture. 

The deflection (A) of a blocked wood structural panel 
shear wall uniformly fastened throughout is permitted to be 
calculated by the use of the following equation:

stress design load combinations is not sufficient to prevent 
uphft due to overturning moments on the wall, an anchoring 
device shall be provided. Anchoring devices shall maintain 
a continuous load path to the foundation. 

2305.3.8 Shear walls with openings. The provisions of this 
section shall apply to the design of shear walls with open- 
ings. Where framing and connections around the openings 
are designed for force transfer around the openings, the pro- 
visions of Section 2305.3.8.1 shall apply. Where framing 
and connections around the openings are not designed for 
force transfer around the openings, the provisions of Sec- 
tion 2305.3.8.2 shall apply. 

2305.3.8.1 Force transfer around openings. Where 
shear walls with openings are designed for force transfer 
around the openings, the limitations of Table 2305.3.4 
shall apply to the overall shear wall, including openings, 
and to each wall pier at the side of an opening. Design for 



force transfer shall be based on a rational analysis. 
Detailing of boundary elements around the opening shall

rated shear walls not having uniform elevations 
shall be designed by other methods. 

6. Perforated shear wall height, h, shall not exceed 
20 feet (6096 mm). 

2305.3.8.2.2 Perforated shear wall resistance. The 

resistance of a perforated shear wall shall be calcu- 
lated in accordance with the following: 

1 . The percentage of full-height sheathing shall be 
calculated as the sum of the widths of perforated 
shear wall segments divided by the total width of 
the perforated shear wall, including openings. 

2. The maximum opening height shall be taken as 
the maximum opening clear height. Where 
areas above and below an opening remain 
unsheathed, the height of the opening shall be 
defined as the height of the wall. 

3. The unadjusted shear resistance shall be the 
allowable shear set forth in Table 2306.4.1 for 
height-to- width ratios of perforated shear wall 
segments that do not exceed 2:1 for seismic 
forces and 3V2:1 for other than seismic forces. 
For seismic forces, where the height-to-width 
ratio of any perforated shear wall segment used 
in the calculation of the sum of the widths of 
perforated shear wall segments, Y, A&gt; is greater 
than 2:1 but does not exceed 3V2:1, the unad- 
justed shear resistance shall be multiplied by 2 
w/h. 

4. The adjusted shear resistance shall be calcu- 
lated by multiplying the unadjusted shear resis- 
tance by the shear resistance adjustment factors 



of Table 2305.3.8.2. For intermediate percent- 
ages of full-height sheathing, the values in 
Table 2305.3.8.2 are permitted to be interpo- 
lated. 

5. The perforated shear wall resistance shall be 
equal to the adjusted shear resistance times the 
sum of the widths of the perforated shear wall 
segments. 

2305.3.8.2.3 Anchorage and load path. Design of 
perforated shear wall anchorage and load path shall 
conform to the requirements of Sections 2305.3.8.2.4 
through 2305.3.8.2.8, or shall be calculated using 
principles of mechanics. Except as modified by these 
sections, wall framing, sheathing, sheathing attach- 
ment and fastener schedules shall conform to the 
requirements of Section 2305 .2.4 and Table 2306.4. 1 . 

2305.3.8.2.4 Uplift anchorage at perforated shear 
wall ends. Anchorage for uplift forces due to over- 
turning shall be provided at each end of the perforated 
shear wall. The uplift anchorage shall conform to the 
requirements of Section 2305.3.7, except that for each 
story the minimum tension chord uplift force, T, shall 
be calculated in accordance with the following: 



T = 



Vh

2305.3.8.2.5 Anchorage for in-plane shear. The unit 
shear force, v, transmitted into the top of a perforated 
shear wall, out of the base of the perforated shear wall 
at full height sheathing and into collectors connecting 
shear wall segments shall be calculated in accordance 
with the following: 



able shear shall be either two times the smaller shear 
capacity or the capacity of the stronger side, whichever is 
greater. 



V = 



V 



Câ^L, 



(Equation 23-4) 



where: 



V = Unit shear force, pounds per lineal feet (N/m) . 

V = Shear force in perforated shear wall, pounds 

(N). 

Q = Shear resistance adjustment factor from Table 
2305.3.8.2. 

Y, A = Sum of widths of perforated shear wall seg- 
ments, feet (mm). 

2305.3.8.2.6 Uplift anchorage between perforated 
shear wall ends. In addition to the requirements of 
Section 2305.3.8.2.4, perforated shear wall bottom 
plates at full-height sheathing shall be anchored for a 
uniform uplift force, t, equal to the unit shear force, v, 
determined in Section 2305.3.8.2.5. 

2305.3.8.2.7 Compression chords. Each end of each 
perforated shear wall segment shall be designed for a 
compression chord force, C, equal to the tension 
chord uplift force, T, calculated in Section 
2305.3.8.2.4. 

2305.3.8.2.8 Load path. Load path. A load path to 
the foundation shall be provided for each uplift force, 
T and t, for each shear force, V and v, and for each 
compression chord force, C. Elements resisting shear 
wall forces contributed by multiple stories shall be 
designed for the sum of forces contributed by each 
story. 

2305.3.8.2.9 Deflection of shear walls with open- 
ings. The controlling deflection of a blocked shear 
wall with openings uniformly fastened throughout 
shall be taken as the maximum individual deflection 
of the shear wall segments calculated in accordance 
with Section 2305.3.2, divided by the appropriate 
shear resistance adjustment factors of Table 
2305.3.8.2. 

2305.3.9 Summing shear capacities. The shear values for 
shear panels of different capacities applied to the same side 
of the wall are not cumulative except as allowed in Table 
2306.4.1. 

The shear values for material of the same type and 
capacity applied to both faces of the same wall are cumula- 
tive. Where the material capacities are not equal, the allow- 



Summing shear capacities of dissimilar materials 
applied to opposite faces or to the same wall line is not 
allowed. 



Exception: For wind design, the allowable shear capac- 
ity of shear wall segments sheathed with a combination 
of wood structural panels and gypsum wallboard on 
opposite faces, fiberboard structural sheathing and gyp- 
sum wallboard on opposite faces or hardboard panel 
siding and gypsum wallboard on opposite faces shall 
equal the sum of the sheathing capacities of each face 
separately. 

2305.3.10 Adhesives. Adhesive attachment of shear wall 
sheathing is not permitted as a substitute for mechanical 
fasteners, and shall not be used in shear wall strength cal- 
culations alone, or in combination with mechanical fasten- 
ers in Seismic Design Category D, E or F. 

2305.3.11 Sill plate size and anchorage in Seismic Design 
Category D, E or E Anchor bolts for shear walls shall 
include steel plate washers, a minimum of 0.229 inch by 3 
inches by 3 inches (5.82 mm by 76 mm by 76 mm) in size, 
between the sill plate and nut. The hole in the plate washer is 
permitted to be diagonally slotted with a width of up to Vjg 
inch (4-76 mm) larger than the bolt diameter and a slot 
length not to exceed IV4 inches (44 mm), provided a stan- 
dard cut washer is placed between the plate washer and the 
nut. Sill plates resisting a design load greater than 490 plf 
(7154 N/m) using load and resistance factor design or 350 
plf (5110 N/m) using allowable stress design shall not be 
less than a 3-inch (76 mm) nominal member. Where a single 
3- inch (76 mm) nominal sill plate is used, 2- 20d box end 
nails shall be substituted for 2- 16d conmion end nails found 
in line 8 of Table 2304.9.1. 

Exception: In shear walls where the design load is 
greater than 490 plf (7151 N/m) but less than 840 plf (12 
264 N/m) using load and resistance factor design or 
greater than 350 plf (5110 N/m) but less than 600 plf 
(8760 N/m) using allowable stress design, the sill plate is 
permitted to be a 2-inch (5 1 mm) nominal member if the 
sill plate is anchored by two times the number of bolts 
required by design and 0.229-inch by 3-inch by 3-inch 
(5.82 mm by 76 mm by 76 mm) plate washers are used.

2306.3 Wood diaphragms. 

2306.3.1 Wood structural panel diaphragms. Wood 
structural panel diaphragms are permitted to resist horizon- 
tal forces using the allowable shear capacities set forth in 
Table 2306.3.1 or 2306.3.2. The allowable shear capacities 
are permitted to be calculated by principles of mechanics 
without limitations by using values for fastener strength in 
the AF&amp;PA NDS, structural design properties for wood 
structural panels based on DOC PS-1 and DOC PS-2 or 
wood structural panel design properties given in the APA 
Panel Design Specification (PDS). 

2306.3.2 Shear capacities modifications. The allowable 
shear capacities in Tables 2306.3.1 and 2306.3.2 for hori- 
zontal wood structural panel diaphragms shall be increased 
40 percent for wind design. 

2306.3.3 Diagonally sheathed lumber diaphragms. 

Diagonally sheathed lumber diaphragms shall be nailed in 
accordance with Table 2306.3.3. 

2306.3.4 Single diagonally sheathed lumber dia- 
phragms. Single diagonally sheathed lumber diaphragms 
shall be constructed of minimum 1-inch (25 mm) thick 
nominal sheathing boards laid at an angle of approximately 
45 degrees (0.78 rad) to the supports. The shear capacity for 
single diagonally sheathed lumber diaphragms of southern 
pine or Douglas fir-larch shall not exceed 300 plf (4378 
N/m) of width. The shear capacities shall be adjusted by 
reduction factors of 0.82 for framing members of species 
with a specific gravity equal to or greater than 0.42 but less 



than 0.49 and 0.65 for species with a specific gravity of less 
than 0.42, as contained in the AF&amp;PA NDS. 

2306.3.4.1 End joints. End joints in adjacent boards 
shall be separated by at least one stud or joist space and 
there shall be at least two boards between joints on the 
same support. 

2306.3.4.2 Single diagonally sheathed lumber dia- 
phragms. Single diagonally sheathed lumber dia- 
phragms made up of 2-inch (51 nrni) nominal diagonal 
lumber sheathing fastened with 16d nails shall be 
designed with the same shear capacities as shear panels 
using 1-inch (25 mm) boards fastened with 8d nails, pro- 
vided there are not splices in adjacent boards on the same 
support and the supports are not less than 4 inch (102 
mm) nominal depth or 3 inch (76 mm) nominal thick- 
ness. 

2306.3.5 Double diagonally sheathed lumber dia- 
phragms. Double diagonally sheathed lumber dia- 
phragms shall be constructed of two layers of diagonal 
sheathing boards at 90 degrees (1.57 rad) to each other on 
the same face of the supporting members. Each chord 
shall be considered as a beam with uniform load per foot 
equal to 50 percent of the unit shear due to diaphragm 
action. The load shall be assumed as acting normal to the 
chord in the plan of the diaphragm in either direction. The 
span of the chord or portion thereof shall be the distance 
between framing members of the diaphragm, such as the 
joists, studs and blocking that serve to transfer the 
assumed load to the sheathing. The shear capacity of dou- 
ble diagonally sheathed diaphragms of Southern pine or 
Douglas fir-larch shall not exceed 600 plf (8756 kN/m) of 
width. The shear capacity shall be adjusted by reduction 
factors of 0. 82 for framing members of species with a spe- 
cific gravity equal to or greater than 0.42 but less than 
0.49 and 0.65 for species with a specific gravity of less 
than 0.42, as contained in the AF&amp;PA NDS. Nailing of 
diagonally sheathed lumber diaphragms shall be in accor- 
dance with Table 2306.3.3. 

2306.3.6 Gypsum board diaphragm ceilings. Gypsum 
board diaphragm ceilings shall be in accordance with Sec- 
tion 2508.5. 

2306.4 Shear walls. Panel sheathing joints in shear waUs shall 
occur over studs or blocking. Adjacent panel sheathing joints shall 
occur over and be nailed to conunon framing members (see Sec- 
tion 2305.3.1 for limitations on shear waU bracing materials).

a. For framing of other species: (1) Find specific gravity for species of lumber in AF&amp;PA NDS. (2) For staples find shear value from table above for Structural I 
panels (regardless of actual grade) and multiply value by 0.82 for species with specific gravity of 0.42 or greater, or 0.65 for all other species. (3) For nails find 
shear value from table above for nail size for actual grade and multiply value by the following adjustment factor: Specific Gravity Adjustment Factor = [l-(0.5 - 
SG)], where SG = Specific Gravity of the framing lumber. This adjustment factor shall not be greater than 1. 

b. Space fasteners maximum 12 inches o.c. along intermediate framing members (6 inches o.c. where supports are spaced 48 inches o.c). 

c. Framing at adjoining panel edges shall be 3 inches nominal or wider, and nails shall be staggered where nails are spaced 2 inches o.c. or 2 Vj inches o.c. 

d. Framing at adjoining panel edges shall be 3 inches nominal or wider, and nails shall be staggered where both of the following conditions are met: (1) lOd 
nails having penetration into framing of more than 1 Vj inches and (2) nails are spaced 3 inches o.c. or less. 

e. 8d is recommended minimum for roofs due to negative pressures of high winds. 

f. Staples shall have a minimum crown width of Vj^ inch and shall be installed with their crowns parallel to the long dimension of the framing members. 

g. The minimum nominal width of framing members not located at boundaries or adjoining panel edges shall be 2 inches. 

h. For shear loads of normal or permanent load duration as defined by the AF&amp;PA NDS, the values in the table above shall be multiplied by 0.63 or 0.56, respectively.

Notes to Table 2306.4.1 

For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm, 1 pound per foot = 14.5939 N/m. 

a. For framing of other species: (1) Find specific gravity for species of lumber in AF&amp;PA NDS. (2) For staples find shear value from table above for Structural I 
panels (regardless of actual grade) and multiply value by 0.82 for species with specific gravity of 0.42 or greater, or 0.65 for all other species. (3) For nails find shear value from table above 
for nail size for actual grade and multiply value by the following adjustment factor: Specific Gravity Adjustment Factor = [I-(0.5 - SG)], where SG = Specific Gravity of the framing lumber. 
This adjustment factor shall not be greater than 1 . 

b. Panel edges backed with 2-inch nominal or wider framing. Install panels either horizontally or vertically. Space fasteners maximum 6 inches on center along intermediate framing members 
for Vg-inch and 7,6-inch panels installed on studs spaced 24 inches on center. For other conditions and panel thickness, space fasteners maximum 12 inches on center on intermediate 
supports. 

c. Vg-inch panel thickness or siding with a span rating of 16 inches on center is the minimum recommended where applied direct to framing as exterior siding. 

d. Allowable shear values are permitted to be increased to values shown for "A^-inch sheathing with same nailing provided (a) studs are spaced a maximum of 16 inches on center, or (b) 
panels are applied with long dimension across studs. 

e. Framing at adjoining panel edges shaU be 3 inches nominal or wider, and nails shall be staggered where nails are spaced 2 inches on center. 

f. Framing at adjoining panel edges shall be 3 inches nominal or wider, and nails shall be staggered where both of the following conditions are met: (1) lOd (3" x 0. 148") nails having 
penetration into framing of more than 1 Vj inches and (2) nails are spaced 3 inches on center. 

g. Values apply to all- veneer plywood. Thickness at point of fastening on panel edges governs shear values. 

h. Where panels apphed on both faces of a wall and nail spacing is less than 6 inches o.c. on either side, panel joints shall be offset to fall on different framing members, or 
framing shall be 3-inch nominal or thicker at adjoining panel edges and nails on each side shall be staggered.

c. Where used to comply with Section 2308.9.3. 

d. Nail length must accommodate the sheathing and penetrate framing iVj inches. 



2308.9.7 Openings in interior nonbearing partitions. 

Openings in nonbearing partitions are permitted to be 
framed with single studs and headers. Each end of a lintel or 
header shall have a length of bearing of not less than 1 Vj 
inches (38 mm) for the full width of the lintel. 

2308.9.8 Pipes in walls. Stud partitions containing plumb- 
ing, heating or other pipes shall be so framed and the joists 
underneath so spaced as to give proper clearance for the pip- 
ing. Where a partition containing such piping runs parallel 
to the floor joists, the joists underneath such partitions shall 
be doubled and spaced to permit the passage of such pipes 
and shall be bridged. Where plumbing, heating or other 
pipes are placed in or partly in a partition, necessitating the 
cutting of the soles or plates, a metal tie not less than 0.058 
inch (1.47 mm) (16 galvanized gage) and IV2 inches (38 
mm) wide shall be fastened to each plate across and to each 
side of the opening with not less than six 16d nails. 

2308.9.9 Bridging. Unless covered by interior or exterior 
wall coverings or sheathing meeting the minimum require- 
ments of this code, stud partitions or walls with studs having 
a height-to-least-thickness ratio exceeding 50 shall have 
bridging not less than 2 inches (51 mm) in thickness and of 
the same width as the studs fitted snugly and nailed thereto 
to provide adequate lateral support. Bridging shall be placed 
in every stud cavity and at a frequency such that no stud so 
braced shall have a height-to-least-thickness ratio exceed- 
ing 50 with the height of the stud measured between hori- 



zontal framing and bridging or between bridging, which- 
ever is greater. 

2308.9.10 Cutting and notching. In exterior walls and 
bearing partitions, any wood stud is permitted to be cut or 
notched to a depth not exceeding 25 percent of its width. 
Cutting or notching of studs to a depth not greater than 40 
percent of the width of the stud is permitted in nonbearing 
partitions supporting no loads other than the weight of the 
partition. 

2308.9.11 Bored holes. A hole not greater in diameter than 
40 percent of the stud width is permitted to be bored in any 
wood stud. Bored holes not greater than 60 percent of the 
width of the stud are permitted in nonbearing partitions or in 
any wall where each bored stud is doubled, provided not 
more than two such successive doubled studs are so bored. 

In no case shall the edge of the bored hole be nearer than 
^/g inch (15.9 mm) to the edge of the stud. 

Bored holes shall not be located at the same section of 
stud as a cut or notch. 

2308.10 Roof and ceiling framing. The framing details 
required in this section apply to roofs having a minimum slope 
of three units vertical in 12 units horizontal (25-percent slope) 
or greater. Where the roof slope is less than three units vertical 
in 12 units horizontal (25-percent slope), members supporting 
rafters and ceiling joists such as ridge board, hips and valleys 
shall be designed as beams.

b. The uplift connection requirements are based on the framing being spaced 24 inches on center. Multiply by 0.67 for framing spaced 1 6 inches on center and multi- 
ply by 0.5 for framing spaced 12 inches on center 

c. The upUft connection requirements include an allowance for 10 pounds of dead load. 

d. The uplift connection requirements do not account for the effects of overhangs. The magnitude of the above loads shall be increased by adding the overhang loads 
found in the table. The overhang loads are also based on framing spaced 24 inches on center. The overhang loads given shall be multiplied by the overhang projec- 
tion and added to the roof uplift value in the table. 

e. The uplift connection requirements are based upon wind loading on end zones as defined in Figure 6-2 of ASCE 7. Connection loads for connections located a dis- 
tance of 20 percent of the least horizontal dimension of the building from the comer of the building are permitted to be reduced by multiplying the table connection 
value by 0.7 and multiplying the overhang load by 0.8. 

f. For wall-to-wall and wall-to-foundation connections, the capacity of the uplift connector is permitted to be reduced by 100 pounds for each full wall above. (For 
example, if a 500-pound rated connector is used on the roof framing, a 400-pound rated connector is permitted at the nect floor level down). 

g. Interpolation is permitted for intermediate values of basic wind speeds and roof spans. 

h. The rated capacity of approved tie-down devices is permitted to include up to a 60-percent increase for wind effects where allowed by material specifications. 



2308.10.1 Wind uplift. Roof assemblies shall have rafter 
and truss ties to the wall below. Resultant uplift loads shall 
be transferred to the foundation using a continuous load 
path. The rafter or truss to wall connection shall comply 
with Tables 2304.9.1 and 2308.10.1. 

2308.10.2 Ceiling joist spans. Allowable spans for ceiling 
joists shall be in accordance with Table 2308.10.2(1) or 
2308.10.2(2). For other grades and species, refer to the 
AF&amp;PA Span Tables for Joists and Rafters. 

2308.10.3 Rafter spans. Allowable spans for rafters shall 
be in accordance with Table 2308.10.3(1), 2308.10.3(2), 
2308.10.3(3), 2308.10.3(4), 2308.10.3(5) or 2308.10.3(6). 
For other grades and species, refer to the AF&amp;PA Span 
Tables for Joists and Rafters. 

2308.10.4 Ceiling joist and rafter framing. Rafters shall 
be framed directly opposite each other at the ridge. There 
shall be a ridge board at least 1-inch (25 mm) nominal thick- 
ness at ridges and not less in depth than the cut end of the raf- 
ter. At valleys and hips, there shall be a single valley or hip 
rafter not less than 2-inch (51 mm) nominal thickness and 
not less in depth than the cut end of the rafter. 

2308.10.4.1 Ceiling joist and rafter connections. Ceil- 
ing joists and rafters shall be nailed to each other and the 
assembly shall be nailed to the top wall plate in accor- 
dance with Tables 2304.9. 1 and 2308. 10. 1 . Ceiling joists 
shall be continuous or securely joined where they meet 
over interior partitions and fastened to adjacent rafters in 
accordance with Tables 2308. 10.4.1 and 2304.9.1 to pro- 



vide a continuous rafter tie across the building where 
such joists are parallel to the rafters. Ceiling joists shall 
have a bearing surface of not less than IV2 inches (38 
mm) on the top plate at each end. 

Where ceiling joists are not parallel to rafters, an 
equivalent rafter tie shall be installed in a manner to pro- 
vide a continuous tie across the building, at a spacing of 
not more than 4 feet (1219 mm) o.c. The connections 
shall be in accordance with Tables 2308.10.4.1 and 
2304.9. 1 , or connections of equivalent capacities shall be 
provided. Where ceiling joists or rafter ties are not pro- 
vided at the top of the rafter support walls, the ridge 
formed by these rafters shall also be supported by a 
girder conforming to Section 2308.4. 

Rafter ties shall be spaced not more than 4 feet (1219 
mm) o.c. Rafter tie connections shall be based on the 
equivalent rafter spacing in Table 2308. 10.4. 1 . Where raf- 
ter ties are spaced at 32 inches (813 mm) o.c, the number 
of 16d common nails shall be two times the number speci- 
fied for rafters spaced 16 inches (406 mm) o.c, with a 
minimum of 4-16d common nails where no snow loads 
are indicated. Where rafter ties are spaced at 48 inches 
(1219 mm) o.c, the number of 16d common nails shall be 
two times the number specified for rafters spaced 24 
inches (610 mm) o.c, with a minimum of 6-16d common 
nails where no snow loads are indicated. Rafter/ceiling 
joist connections and rafter/tie connections shall be of suf- 
ficient size and number to prevent splitting from nailing.

affect the performance of the conventional framing system. 
A portion of a structure shall be considered to be irregular 



where one or more of the conditions described in Items 1 
through 6 below are present. 

1 . Where exterior braced wall panels are not in one plane 
vertically from the foundation to the uppermost story 
in which they are required, the structure shall be con- 
sidered to be irregular [see Figure 2308.12.6(1)]. 

Exception: Floors with cantilevers or setbacks not 
exceeding four times the nominal depth of the 
floor joists [see Figure 2308. 12.6(2)] are permitted 
to support braced wall panels provided: 

1 . Floor joists are 2 inches by 10 inches (5 1 mm 
by 254 mm) or larger and spaced not more 
than 16 inches (406 mm) o.c. 

2. The ratio of the back span to the cantilever is 
at least 2:1. 

3. Floor joists at ends of braced wall panels are 
doubled. 

4. A continuous rim joist is connected to the 
ends of cantilevered joists. The rim joist is 
permitted to be spliced using a metal tie not 
less than 0.058 inch (1.47 mm) (16 galva- 
nized gage) and IV2 inches (38 mm) wide 
fastened With six 16d common nails on each 
side. The metal tie shall have a minimum 
yield of/33,000 psi (227 MPa). 

5. Joists at setbacks or the end of cantilevered 
joists shall not carry gravity loads from more 
than a single story having uniform wall and 
roof loads, nor carry the reactions from 
headers having a span of 8 feet (2438 mm) or 
more. 

2. Where a section of floor or roof is not laterally sup- 
ported by braced wall lines on all edges, the structure 
shall be considered to be irregular [see Figure 
2308.12.6(3)]. 

Exception: Portions of roofs or floors that do not 
support braced wall panels above are permitted to

the air pressure is directly against that skin. 

CABLE-RESTRAINED, AIR-SUPPORTED STRUC- 
TURE. A structure in which the uplift is resisted by cables or 
webbings which are anchored to either foundations or dead 
men. Reinforcing cable or webbing is attached by various 
methods to the membrane or is an integral part of the mem- 
brane. This is not a cable-supported structure. 

MEMBRANE-COVERED CABLE STRUCTURE. A 

nonpressurized structure in which a mast and cable system pro- 
vides support and tension to the membrane weather barrier and 
the membrane imparts stability to the structure.

by more than 5 percent, unless the increased forces on the ele- 
ment are still in compliance with the code for new structures, 
nor shall the strength of any structural element be decreased to 
less than that required by this code for new structures. Where 
repairs are made to structural elements of an existing building, 
and uncovered structural elements are found to be unsound or 
otherwise structurally deficient, such elements shall be made to 
conform to the requirements for new structures. 

3403.2.1 Existing live load. Where an existing structure 
heretofore is altered or repaired, the minimum design loads 
for the structure shall be the loads applicable at the time of 
erection, provided that public safety is not endangered 
thereby. 

3403.2.2 Live load reduction. If the approved live load is 
less than required by Section 1607, the areas designed for 
the reduced live load shall be posted in with the approved 
load. Placards shall be of an approved design. 

3403.2.3 Seismic. Additions, alterations or modification or 
change of occupancy of existing buildings shall be in accor- 
dance with this section for the purposes of seismic consider- 
ations. 

3403.2.3.1 Additions to existing buildings. An addition 
that is structurally independent from an existing struc- 
ture shall be designed and constructed with the seismic 
requirements for new structures. An addition that is not

EXISTING STRUCTURES 



structurally independent from an existing structure shall 
be designed and constructed such that the entire structure 
conforms to the seismic-force-resistance requirements 
for new structures unless the following conditions are 
satisfied: 

1 . The addition conforms with the requirements for 
new structures, 

2. The addition does not increase the seismic forces 
in any structural element of the existing structure 
by more than 10 percent cumulative since the orig- 
inal construction, unless the element has the 
capacity to resist the increased forces determined 
in accordance with ASCE 7, and 

3 . Additions do not decrease the seismic resistance of 
any structural element of the existing structure by 
more than 10 percent cumulative since the original 
construction, unless the element has the capacity 
to resist the forces determined in accordance with 
ASCE 7. If the building's seismic base shear 
capacity has been increased since the original con- 
struction, the percent change in base shear may be 
calculated relative to the increased value. 

3403.2.3.2 Alterations. Alterations are permitted to be 
made to any structure without requiring the structure to 
comply with Section 1613, provided the alterations con- 
form to the requirements for a new structure. Alterations 
that increase the seismic force in any existing structural 
element by more than 10 percent cumulative since the 
original construction or decrease the design strength of 
any existing structural element to resist seismic forces by 
more than 5 percent cumulative since the original con- 
struction shall not be permitted unless the entire seis- 
mic-force-resisting system is determined to conform to 
ASCE 7 for a new structure. If the building's seismic 
base shear capacity has been increased since the original 
construction, the percent change in base shear may be 
calculated relative to the increased value. 

Exception: Alterations to existing structural ele- 
ments or additions of new structural elements that are 
not required by ASCE 7 and are initiated for the pur- 
pose of increasing the strength or stiffness of the seis- 
mic-force-resisting system of an existing structure 
need not be designed for forces conforming to ASCE 
7, provided that an engineering analysis is submitted 
indicating the following: 

1. The design strength of existing structural ele- 
ments required to resist seismic forces is not 
reduced. 

2. The seismic force to required existing structural 
elements is not increased beyond their design 
strength. 

3. New structural elements are detailed and con- 
nected to the existing structural elements as 
required by Chapter 16. 

4. New or relocated nonstructural elements are 
detailed and connected to existing or new struc- 
tural elements as required by Chapter 16. 



5 . The alterations do not create a structural irregu- 
larity as defined in ASCE 7 or make an existing 
structural irregularity more severe. 

6. The alterations do not result in the creation of an 
unsafe condition. 

3403.3 Nonstructural. Nonstructural alterations or repairs to 
an existing building or structure are permitted to be made of the 
same materials of which the building or structure is con- 
structed, provided that they do not adversely affect any struc- 
tural member or the fire-resistance rating of any part of the 
building or structure.

intended to maintain or increase the current degree of public 
safety, health and general welfare in existing buildings while 
permitting repair, alteration, addition and change of occupancy 



without requiring full compliance with Chapters 2 through 33, 
or Sections 3401.3, and 3403 through 3407, except where com- 
pliance with other provisions of this code is specifically 
required in this section. 

3410.2 Applicability. Structures existing prior to [DATE TO BE 

INSERTED BY THE JURISDICTION. NOTE: IT IS RECOMMENDED 
THAT THIS DATE COINCIDE WITH THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF BUILD- 
ING CODES V^THIN THE JURISDICTION], in which there is work 
involving additions, alterations or changes of occupancy shall 
be made to conform to the requirements of this section or the 
provisions of Sections 3403 through 3407. The provisions in 
Sections 3410.2.1 through 3410.2.5 shall apply to existing 
occupancies that will continue to be, or are proposed to be, in 
Groups A, B, E, F, M, R, S and U. These provisions shall not 
apply to buildings with occupancies in Group H or I. 

3410.2.1 Change in occupancy. Where an existing build- 
ing is changed to a new occupancy classification and this 
section is applicable, the provisions of this section for the 
new occupancy shall be used to determine compliance with 
this code. 

3410.2.2 Partial change in occupancy. Where a portion of 
the building is changed to a new occupancy classification, 
and that portion is separated from the remainder of the 
building with fire barriers or horizontal assemblies having a 
fire-resistance rating as required by Table 508.3.3 for the 
separate occupancies, or with approved compliance alterna- 
tives, the portion changed shall be made to conform to the 
provisions of this section. 

Where a portion of the building is changed to a new occu- 
pancy classification, and that portion is not separated from 
the remainder of the building with fire barriers or horizontal 
assemblies having a fire-resistance rating as required by 
Table 508.3.3 for the separate occupancies, or with 
approved compliance alternatives, the provisions of this 
section which apply to each occupancy shall apply to the 
entire building. Where there are conflicting provisions, 
those requirements which secure the greater public safety 
shall apply to the entire building or structure. 

3410.2.3 Additions. Additions to existing buildings shall 
comply with the requirements of this code for new construc- 
tion. The combined height and area of the existing building 
and the new addition shall not exceed the height and area 
allowed by Chapter 5. Where a fire wall that comphes with

ered by this section, the building owner shall cause the existing 
building to be investigated and evaluated in accordance with 
the provisions of this section. 

3410.4.1 Structural analysis. The owner shall have a struc- 
tural analysis of the existing building made to determine 
adequacy of structural systems for the proposed alteration, 
addition or change of occupancy. The existing building shall 
be capable of supporting the minimum load requirements of 
Chapter 16. 

3410.4.2 Submittal. The results of the investigation and 
evaluation as required in Section 3410.4, along with pro- 
posed compliance alternatives, shall be submitted to the 
building official. 

3410.4.3 Determination of compliance. The building offi- 
cial shall determine whether the existing building, with the 
proposed addition, alteration or change of occupancy, com- 
plies with the provisions of this section in accordance with 
the evaluation process in Sections 3410.5 through 3410.9. 

3410.5 Evaluation. The evaluation shall be comprised of three 
categories: fire safety, means of egress and general safety, as 
defined in Sections 3410.5.1 through 3410.5.3. 

3410.5.1 Fire safety. Included within the fire safety cate- 
gory are the structural fire resistance, automatic fire detec- 
tion, fire alarm and fire suppression system features of the 
facility. 

3410.5.2 Means of egress. Included within the means of 
egress category are the configuration, characteristics and 
support features for means of egress in the facility. 

3410.5.3 General safety. Included within the general safety 
category are the fire safety parameters and the means of 
egress parameters. 

3410.6 Evaluation process. The evaluation process specified 
herein shall be followed in its entirety to evaluate existing 
buildings. Table 3410.7 shall be utilized for tabulating the 
results of the evaluation. References to other sections of this 
code indicate that compliance with those sections is required in 



order to gain credit in the evaluation herein outlined. In apply- 
ing this section to a building with mixed occupancies, where 
the separation between the mixed occupancies does not qualify 
for any category indicated in Section 3410.6.16, the score for 
each occupancy shall be determined and the lower score deter- 
mined for each section of the evaluation process shall apply to 
the entire building. 

Where the separation between the mixed occupancies quali- 
fies for any category indicated in Section 3410.6.16, the score 
for each occupancy shall apply to each portion of the building 
based on the occupancy of the space. 

3410.6.1 Building height. The value for building height 
shall be the lesser value determined by the formula in Sec- 
tion 3410.6.1.1. Chapter 5 shall be used to determine the 
allowable height of the building, including allowable 
increases due to automatic sprinklers as provided for in Sec- 
tion 504.2. Subtract the actual building height from the 
allowable and divide by 12 V2 feet. Enter the height value 
and its sign (positive or negative) in Table 3410.7 under 
Safety Parameter 3410.6.1, Building Height, for fire safety, 
means of egress and general safety. The maximum score for 
a building shall be 10. 

3410.6.1.1 Height formula. The following formulas 
shall be used in computing the building height value. 

Height value, feet = ^^^~^ ^^^ x CF 

Height value, stories =(A5 - EBS) x CF 

(Equation 34-1) 

where: 

AH = Allowable height in feet from Table 503. 

EBH = Existing building height in feet. 

AS = Allowable height in stories from Table 503. 

EBS = Existing building height in stories. 

CF = 1 if (AH) - (EBH) is positive. 

CF = Construction-type factor shown in Table 
3410.6.6(2) if (AH) - (EBH) is negative. 

Note: Where mixed occupancies are separated and indi- 
vidually evaluated as indicated in Section 3410.6, the 
values AH, AS, EBH and EBS shall be based on the 
height of the fire area of the occupancy being evaluated.

with Chapter 9. 

6. Category f â Sprinklers are not required through- 
out; sprinklers are provided throughout in accor- 
dance with Chapter 9. 

3410.6.18 Incidental use. Evaluate the protection of inci- 
dental use areas in accordance with Section 508.2. Do not 
include those where this code requires suppression through- 
out the building including covered mall buildings, high-rise 
buildings, public garages and unlimited area buildings. 
Assign the lowest score from Table 3410.6.18 for the build- 
ing or fire area being evaluated. If there are no specific occu- 
pancy areas in the building or fire area being evaluated, the 
value shall be zero. 

3410.7 Building score. After determining the appropriate data 
from Section 3410.6, enter those data in Table 3410.7 and total 
the building score. 

3410.8 Safety scores. The values in Table 3410.8 are the 
required mandatory safety scores for the evaluation process 
listed in Section 3410.6. 

3410.9 Evaluation of building safety. The mandatory safety 
score in Table 3410.8 shall be subtracted from the building 
score in Table 3410.7 for each category. Where the final score 
for any category equals zero or more, the building is in compli- 
ance with the requirements of this section for that category. 
Where the final score for any category is less than zero, the 
building is not in compliance with the requirements of this sec- 
tion.

sive regulations for management of flood hazard areas 
designed to: 

1 . Prevent unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and 
public service during times of flooding; 

2. Manage the alteration of natural flood plains, stream 
channels and shorelines; 

3. Manage filling, grading, dredging and other develop- 
ment which may increase flood damage or erosion 
potential; 

4. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers 
which will divert floodwaters or which can increase 
flood hazards; and 

5. Contribute to improved construction techniques in the 
flood plain. 



G1(D)1.2 OlbjectnveSo The objectives of this appendix are to pro- 
tect human Ufe, minimize the expenditure of public money for 
flood control projects, minimize the need for rescue and relief 
efforts associated with flooding, minimize prolonged business 
interruption, minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, 
help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use 
and development of flood-prone areas, contribute to improved 
construction techniques in the flood plain and ensure that 
potential owners and occupants are notified that property is 
within flood hazard areas. 



3 Scope, The provisions of this appendix shall apply to 
all proposed development in a flood hazard area established in 
Section 1612 of this code, including certain building work 
exempt from permit under Section 105.2. 



IS. Any violation of a provision of this appen- 
dix, or failure to comply with a permit or variance issued pursu- 
ant to this appendix or any requirement of this appendix, shall 
be handled in accordance with Section 113. 



APPLiCABQLllTY

including restoration after damage; and certain building work 
exempt from permit under Section 105.2. 



areas. Flood hazard 
areas are established in Section 1612.3 of the International 
Building Code, adopted by the governing body on [INSERT 
DATE]. 



POWERS kMB DUTDES 

G103ol Permalt applkaitjomso The building official shall 
review all permit applications to determine whether proposed 
development sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a 
proposed development site is in a flood hazard area, all site 
development activities (including grading, filling, utility 
installation and drainage modification), all new construction 
and substantial improvements (including the placement of pre- 
fabricated buildings and manufactured homes) and certain 
building work exempt from permit under Section 105.2 shall be 
designed and constructed with methods, practices and materi- 
als that minimize flood damage and that are in accordance with 
this code and ASCE 24. 



It shall be the responsibility of the 
building official to assure that approval of a proposed develop- 
ment shall not be given until proof that necessary permits have 
been granted by federal or state agencies having jurisdiction 
over such development. 

Gl(D)3o3 Deteomiiiiatioiii of desigm ffloodl elevaltioinis. If design 
flood elevations are not specified, the building official is autho- 
rized to require the applicant to: 

1. Obtain, review and reasonably utilize data available 
from a federal, state or other source, or 

2. Determine the design flood elevation in accordance with 
accepted hydrologic and hydraulic engineering tech- 
niques. Such analyses shall be performed and sealed by a 
registered design professional. Studies, analyses and 
computations shall be submitted in sufficient detail to 
allow review and approval by the building official. The 
accuracy of data submitted for such determination shall 
be the responsibility of the applicant. 



m. riverime IHood hazairdl areas. In riverine 
flood hazard areas where design flood elevations are specified 
but floodways have not been designated, the building official 
shall not permit any new construction, substantial improve- 
ment or other development, including fill, unless the applicant 
demonstrates that the cumulative effect of the proposed devel-

APPEND8X G 



opment, when combined with all other existing and anticipated 
flood hazard area encroachment, will not increase the design 
flood elevation more than 1 foot (305 mm) at any point within 
the community. 

G1Â®3.S Floodway encroachment. Prior to issuing a permit for 
any floodway encroachment, including fill, new construction, 
substantial improvements and other development or land-dis- 
turbing activity, the building official shall require submission 
of a certification, along with supporting technical data, that 
demonstrates that such development will not cause any 
increase of the level of the base flood. 



ms. A floodway encroachment 
that increases the level of the base flood is authorized if the 
applicant has applied for a conditional Flood Insurance Rate 
Map (FIRM) revision and has received the approval of the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 

G103.6 Watercourse alteration. Prior to issuing a permit for 
any alteration or relocation of any watercourse, the building 
official shall require the applicant to provide notification of the 
proposal to the appropriate authorities of all affected adjacent 
government jurisdictions, as well as appropriate state agencies. 
A copy of the notification shall be maintained in the permit 
records and submitted to FEMA. 

GlÂ©3Â«6.1 Emgineering analysis. The building official shall 
require submission of an engineering analysis which dem- 
onstrates that the flood-carrying capacity of the altered or 
relocated portion of the watercourse will not be decreased. 
Such watercourses shall be maintained in a manner which 
preserves the channel's flood-carrying capacity. 

G103.7 Alterations in coastal areas. Prior to issuing a permit 
for any alteration of sand dunes and mangrove stands in flood 
hazard areas subject to high velocity wave action, the building 
official shall require submission of an engineering analysis 
which demonstrates that the proposed alteration will not 
increase the potential for flood damage. 

G103.8 Records. The building official shall maintain a perma- 
nent record of all permits issued in flood hazard areas, includ- 
ing copies of inspection reports and certifications required in 
Section 1612. 



similar description that will readily identify and defi- 
nitely locate the site. 

3. Include a site plan showing the delineation of flood haz- 
ard areas, floodway boundaries, flood zones, design 
flood elevations, ground elevations, proposed fill and 
excavation and drainage patterns and facilities. 

4. Indicate the use and occupancy for which the proposed 
development is intended. 

5. Be accompanied by construction documents, grading 
and filling plans and other information deemed appropri- 
ate by the building official. 

6. State the valuation of the proposed work. 

7. Be signed by the applicant or the applicant's authorized 
agent.

1.3 Validity of permit. The issuance of a permit under this 
appendix shall not be construed to be a permit for, or approval 
of, any violation of this appendix or any other ordinance of the 
jurisdiction. The issuance of a permit based on submitted docu- 
ments and information shall not prevent the building official 
from requiring the correction of errors. The building official is 
authorized to prevent occupancy or use of a structure or site 
which is in violation of this appendix or other ordinances of this 
jurisdiction. 



.4 Expiration. A permit shall become invalid if the pro- 
posed development is not commenced within 180 days after its 
issuance, or if the work authorized is suspended or abandoned 
for a period of 180 days after the work commences. Extensions 
shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause demon- 
strated. The building official is authorized to grant, in writing, 
one or more extensions of time, for periods not more than 180 
days each. 

G104.5 Suspension or revocation. The building official is 
authorized to suspend or revoke a permit issued under this 
appendix wherever the permit is issued in error or on the basis 
of incorrect, inaccurate or incomplete information, or in viola- 
tion of any ordinance or code of this jurisdiction. 



G104.1 Required, Any person, owner or authorized agent who 
intends to conduct any development in a flood hazard area shall 
first make application to the building official and shall obtain 
the required permit. 

G104.2 Application for permit. The applicant shall file an 
application in writing on a form furnished by the building offi- 
cial. Such application shall: 

1 . Identify and describe the development to be covered by 
the permit. 

2. Describe the land on which the proposed development is 
to be conducted by legal description, street address or 



GlOS.l General. The board of appeals established pursuant to 
Section 112 shall hear and decide requests for variances. The 
board of appeals shall base its determination on technical justi- 
fications, and has the right to attach such conditions to vari- 
ances as it deems necessary to further the purposes and 
objectives of this appendix and Section 1612. 

G105.2 Records. The building official shall maintain a perma- 
nent record of all variance actions, including justification for 
their issuance. 



A variance is authorized to be 
issued for the repair or rehabilitation of a historic structure 
upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation 
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a his-

preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 



repair of public utihties and facilities such as sewer, 
gas, electrical and water systems, streets and bridges. 



ms Within flood hazard areas, historic structures 
that are not: 

1 . Listed or preliminarily determined to be eligible for 
listing in the National Register of Historic Places; or 

2. Determined by the Secretary of the U.S. Department 
of Interior as contributing to the historical signifi- 
cance of a registered historic district or a district pre- 
liminarily determined to qualify as an historic district; 
or 

3. Designated as historic under a state or local historic 
preservation program that is approved by the Depart- 
ment of Interior. 



A variance is 

authorized to be issued for the construction or substantial 
improvement of a functionally dependent facility provided the 
criteria in Section 1612. 1 are met and the variance is the mini- 
mum necessary to allow the construction or substantial 
improvement, and that all due consideration has been given to 
methods and materials that minimize flood damages during the 
design flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 



The board of appeals shall not issue a 
variance for any proposed development in a floodway if any 
increase in flood levels would result during the base flood dis- 
charge. 



3o In reviewing applications for vari- 
ances, the board of appeals shall consider all technical evalua- 
tions, all relevant factors, all other portions of this appendix and 
the following: 

1 . The danger that materials and debris may be swept onto 
other lands resulting in further injury or damage; 

2. The danger to life and property due to flooding or ero- 
sion damage; 

3. The susceptibility of the proposed development, 
including contents, to flood damage and the effect of 
such damage on current and future owners; 

4. The importance of the services provided by the pro- 
posed development to the community; 

5. The availability of alternate locations for the proposed 
development that are not subject to flooding or erosion; 

6. The compatibility of the proposed development with 
existing and anticipated development; 

7. The relationship of the proposed development to the 
comprehensive plan and flood plain management pro- 
gram for that area; 

8 . The safety of access to the property in times of flood for 
ordinary and emergency vehicles; 

9. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise 
and debris and sediment transport of the floodwaters 
and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at 
the site; and 

10. The costs of providing governmental services during 
and after flood conditions including maintenance and 



DSo7 ComdHMoinis for nssiiamiceo Variances shall only be 
issued by the board of appeals upon: 

1 . A technical showing of good and sufficient cause that the 
unique characteristics of the size, configuration or 
topography of the site renders the elevation standards 
inappropriate; 

2. A determination that failure to grant the variance would 
result in exceptional hardship by rendering the lot 
undevelopable; 

3. A determination that the granting of a variance will not 
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to 
public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create 
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public 
or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances; 

4. A determination that the variance is the minimum neces- 
sary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and 

5 . Notification to the applicant in writing over the signature 
of the building official that the issuance of a variance to 
construct a structure below the base flood level will 
result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up 
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance cover- 
age, and that such construction below the base flood 
level increases risks to life and property.
